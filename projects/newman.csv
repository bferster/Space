Born in 1919, he graduated from Tech High School in 1937 and began working for the commercial and industrial photographer George Haley shortly after graduation. In 1939 Don married Bertha Mae to whom he was married until he passed away in 1994.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Newman worked briefly as a photographer for the Memphis Engraving Company, and then for Frank Hitchings, whom he eventually bought out with Jack Fury after Hitching&rsquo;s retirement. Many of the photographs in the Newman archive were produced for assignments or jobs, however a large number were made to satisfy his personal curiosity and interests.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">The photographs are black and white, and the scenes are familiar to Memphians born after Newman&rsquo;s time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">The equipment &ndash; an 80-pound tripod, 25-pound view camera and 10 film holders, each the size of a large briefcase &ndash; would be carried around town. A photographer in 1950 in the middle of a Memphis summer had his work cut out for him.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">For more than four decades, a man of great aspirations captured a city with a great ambition. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then Don Newman&rsquo;s photographs give us a history book&rsquo;s worth of tales. They are the stories of where people shopped, what they wore, the cars they drove and spaces where they worked, ate and played.</span></p><p>.</p><iframe width=""560"" height=""280"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLbPnyYZnLg"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe width=""560"" height=""280"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxz53aMNowo"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p>",,1,,,,,,,,"-90.0368,35.1309,19",,,,

The style can be identified by steeply pitched, cross-gabled roofs, highly decorated vergeboards along the gables, and pointed-arch, or Gothic arch, windows that extend into the gables. Elements are commonly styled with flattened or full Gothic arches, trefoil and quatrefoil designs, tracery, and in some instances, castellated parapet walls.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">A part of the Picturesque/Romantic Movement, the Gothic Revival looked back to medieval Europe instead of ancient Greece and Rome. The asymmetrical floorplans of the residential Gothic forms complemented a building&rsquo;s natural setting, while more symmetrical, high-style designs were found on churches. After Memphis rebounded from the Civil War and multiple Yellow Fever epidemics, the 1880s and 1890s again brought economic prosperity to the Bluff City.

Perhaps the most famous Commercial Gothic structure is the Woolworth Building in New York City, which gained the nickname &ldquo;The Cathedral of Commerce&rdquo; for its combination of sacred and commercial influences. Commercial Gothic structures were largely built in New York, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia between 1910 and 1930.

The ornate style can be identified by a heavily decorated, symmetrical fa&ccedil;ade with classical detailing, including pediments and paired columns and pilasters. The heaviness and formality of the style that favored ancient motifs made it ubiquitous with cultural and government buildings at the turn of the century.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Influenced by classical Roman and Greek forms, it was the style of choice for the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; at the 1893 World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which introduced the aesthetic of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to the American public. The pleasing symmetry and monumental grandeur of the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; influenced the City Beautiful movement, which pushed urban beautification efforts to increase civic virtue in overcrowded and impoverished cities across the country, Memphis included.

The ornate style can be identified by a heavily decorated, symmetrical fa&ccedil;ade with classical detailing, including pediments and paired columns and pilasters. The heaviness and formality of the style that favored ancient motifs made it ubiquitous with cultural and government buildings at the turn of the century.&nbsp;</p><p>Influenced by classical Roman and Greek forms, it was the style of choice for the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; at the 1893 World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which introduced the aesthetic of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to the American public. The pleasing symmetry and monumental grandeur of the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; influenced the City Beautiful movement, which pushed urban beautification efforts to increase civic virtue in overcrowded and impoverished cities across the country, Memphis included.

Built in 1907 by local architects Shaw &amp; Pfeil, who also built the Beaux Arts Tennessee Trust Building (now Hu. Hotel) in 1904, the building has a distinctive rusticated first floor and an abundance of classical ornamentation, from a front-facing pair of two-story Ionic columns to the cast-stone ornaments along the cornice.&nbsp;</p><p>story(back to Beaux Arts,beauxStory)</p>",,,,,,,,,,"-90.0076,35.1261",hide,,,

moreShell,booklet,,,About the Overton Park Shell,"<p>The Overton Park Shell was built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1936 to provide a venue for outdoor entertainment.&nbsp;This was one of 27 band shells built by the WPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;The outdoor amphitheater was massively popular from the start, exceeding its 4,000-person seat capacity by 2,000 on its first night. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the Memphis Open Air Theater (MOAT) and the Memphis Federation of Musicians put on musicals and other programs at the Shell. During this time period, the MOAT served as the main source of entertainment programming at the Shell.&nbsp;</p><p>Beginning in the late 1940s, however, the Shell began grappling with dwindling popularity and deteriorating facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mid-1960s, the Shell had been slated for demolition to be replaced by a performing arts building, but the Memphis Opera Theater (MOT) revived interest in the Shell by putting on a trial of summer concerts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This renewed interest in free summer concerts sustained the Shell for another twenty years. Rock artists became a staple at the Shell in the 1970s.</p><p>In 1982, the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ) tried to pool funds for Shell restoration, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Their endeavor resulted in the Shell being renamed the Raoul Wallenberg Shell in honor of the Swedish diplomat who aided Jews during the Holocaust. Without renovations, however, the Shell fell into disuse by the mid-1980s and was once again at risk of demolition.</p><p>Citizens responded strongly to the abandonment of the Shell. From 1984 to 1985,&nbsp;The Commercial Appealprinted a series of letters opposing the demolition of the Shell, with one suggesting that the Shell be renovated in time for its 50thanniversary the following year. After the Arts in the Park festival of 1984, Mayor Dick Hackett announced that he would support renovating the Shell if a private group would establish an arts program. This promise inspired Memphis local John Hanrahan to form Save Our Shell (SOS), an activist group dedicated to renovating the Shell and organizing events to celebrate its 50thanniversary. After his sudden death in 1986, Hanrahan&rsquo;s family and friends continued organizing on his behalf. The Shell operated under the auspices of SOS for the next eighteen years. In 1987, the group received $15,000 from the City Council to build handicapped bathrooms, pave a parking lot for performers, and establish an office phone. SOS were also successful in planning a wide array of summer performances, including jazz, pop, and classical music concerts.</p><p>In 2004, however, an engineering inspection commissioned by Park Services found hazardous conditions that rendered the Shell inhospitable. The report concluded that repairs would cost $500,000, while removing the Shell would only cost $50,000. Although neither SOS nor the City had the money to renovate the Shell, the Mortimer and Levitt Foundation, a California-based organization dedicated to improving old band shells, became interested in the Shell that same year. In 2005, the City and the Friends of Levitt Shell began a $1.3 million renovation of the Shell.</p><p>The newly christened Levitt Shell opened in August 2008 to its signature summer concert series, highlighting performances of R&amp;B, gospel, Americana, jazz, Latin music, and children&rsquo;s shows. Today the Shell continues to offer free summer concerts, along with a range of interactive shows.</p>",,,,45,,,,,,"-89.9901,35.1429",,,,

morePeabody,booklet,,,Peabody Hotel,"<p>The original Peabody Hotel opened in 1869.&nbsp;&nbsp;A new building opened at its present location in 1925.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout its history, it has been widely known as &ldquo;the South&rsquo;s grand hotel.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;It became the social and business hub of Memphis.&nbsp;Ducks have been a regular feature in the hotel&rsquo;s lobby fountain since their introduction in a 1933 prank. &nbsp;Beginning in 1937 the music of the Peabody&rsquo;s bands was broadcast nationwide on CBS radio.&nbsp;&nbsp;In its prime, the hotel&rsquo;s lower two floors contained 40 retail shops and offices, as well as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary, Kiwanis, and Civitan clubs.</p><p>The Peabody was filled to capacity during the World War II period.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was forced to implement a maximum stay of three days.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the hotel began to decline during the 1950s due to a variety of factors, such as suburbanization, the rise of chain hotels, desegregation, and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel was sold multiple times between the 1950s and 1970s.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, it was actually known as the Peabody-Sheraton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Peabody was purchased at auction by Belz Enterprises in 1975.&nbsp;&nbsp;Belz Enterprises held the mortgage for the hotel at the time of the auction, so the purchase was at least in part financially motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Belz Family, which owns Belz enterprises, also had a deeply personal connection to The Peabody Hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one example, among many important family celebrations, Jack Belz was married at The Peabody in 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jack Belz had a strong vision of The Peabody&rsquo;s potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that if the restoration was done on a grand scale, the hotel would have the power to pull the entire downtown area up.&nbsp;&nbsp;The renovation restored early features of the hotel such as stained-glass panels and decorative medallions on ceilings that had been covered with acoustical tile.</p><p>Funding was a major challenge in the restoration effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;It took over 5 years to set up a loan deal, and this led to public questions about the hotel&rsquo;s future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, a solution was found in the development of a funding pool, and this model has provided an important blueprint for other endeavors.</p><p>After an extensive, multi-million-dollar restoration that brought The Peabody back to its former glory, it reopened in 1981.&nbsp;The reopening of The Peabody is considered to be a catalyst event for the renaissance of downtown Memphis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Peabody was named the nation&rsquo;s best historic hotel in the 2018&nbsp;USA Today&rsquo;s&nbsp;Readers&rsquo; Choice awards.</p>",,,,50,,,,,,"-90.0082,35.1324",,,,

The City of Memphis also agreed to contribute $15 million for Crosstown redevelopment.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">A groundbreaking celebration was held in February 2015, and the Crosstown Concourse officially opened in August 2017 as a &ldquo;vertical urban village&rdquo; containing residential, commercial, educational, healthcare, and arts facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crosstown Concourse, as the Sears Crosstown building was renamed, was the largest historic adaptive reuse LEED Building Design and Construction Platinum project in the world.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">As of the beginning of 2019, the Crosstown Concourse contains 13 restaurants, 6 retail stores, an art gallery, a charter high school, 3 medical/dental establishments, a variety of non-profits, and 270 apartments.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">The Crosstown Concours has received numerous awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure was honored in 2017 by&nbsp;The Architectural Review&nbsp;magazine with a nomination to a shortlist of 15 structures worldwide for its significance in adaptive use and retrofit &ldquo;in a world with a growing awareness of the environmental implications of building anew&rdquo; and the &ldquo;re-appropriation of disused infrastructure.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, the National Trust for Historic Preservation awarded the Crosstown Concourse the extremely prestigious&nbsp;Richard H.

moreCrosstown,booklet,,,About Sears Crosstown / Crosstown Concourse,"<p>Sears Crosstown was built at the extreme eastern edge of Memphis.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one of the first Sears retail outlets in the South and only the fifth catalogue order fulfillment center in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also the largest building in Memphis at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facility became an important social and economic fixture in Memphis.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a leading employer through the Depression and World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also a top destination for shopping and socializing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears Crosstown was so successful that in five additions were made to the building in 1965, growing it to over 1,500,000 square feet.</p><p>During the 1950s,&nbsp;Sears began opening locations in the suburbs, which ultimately diminished the importance of the Crosstown location.&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail store closed in 1983 and the customer credit center and catalog merchandise distribution center in 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;The building was put up for sale and vacated in 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;This led to fears regarding the decline of the surrounding area, and other businesses in the area also closed during that time.</p><p>Beginning in 1999, several attempts were made to renovate and reuse Sears Crosstown.&nbsp;However, early attempts were aborted after failure to secure necessary funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort that ultimately succeeded began in 2010 when Todd Richardson and Christopher Miner established Crosstown Arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization&nbsp;led the effort to redevelop the Sears Crosstown building into a vibrant center piece of the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During 2012, the founding partners for the Crosstown Concourse were announced.&nbsp;&nbsp;These&nbsp;included the Church Health Center, Memphis Teacher Residency, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital, and ALSAC/St. Jude, among other highly-regarded institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;After three years of fundraising, the partnership secured $200 million in financing from 30 different sources to redevelop the Sears Crosstown building.&nbsp;In 2013, the Center City Commission granted&nbsp;Crosstown a 20-year PILOT (payment-in-lieu-of taxes) deal. The City of Memphis also agreed to contribute $15 million for Crosstown redevelopment.</p><p>A groundbreaking celebration was held in February 2015, and the Crosstown Concourse officially opened in August 2017 as a &ldquo;vertical urban village&rdquo; containing residential, commercial, educational, healthcare, and arts facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crosstown Concourse, as the Sears Crosstown building was renamed, was the largest historic adaptive reuse LEED Building Design and Construction Platinum project in the world.</p><p>As of the beginning of 2019, the Crosstown Concourse contains 13 restaurants, 6 retail stores, an art gallery, a charter high school, 3 medical/dental establishments, a variety of non-profits, and 270 apartments.</p><p>The Crosstown Concours has received numerous awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure was honored in 2017 by&nbsp;The Architectural Review&nbsp;magazine with a nomination to a shortlist of 15 structures worldwide for its significance in adaptive use and retrofit &ldquo;in a world with a growing awareness of the environmental implications of building anew&rdquo; and the &ldquo;re-appropriation of disused infrastructure.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, the National Trust for Historic Preservation awarded the Crosstown Concourse the extremely prestigious&nbsp;Richard H. Driehaus Foundation National Preservation Award.</p>",,,,45,,,,,,"-89.9963,35.1567",,,,

Nationwide prohibition during the 1920s and 1930s, however, temporarily halted operations at the Brewery. The Brewery resumed production in 1933, and it became best known for its production of Goldcrest 51 Beer, which became the largest selling beer in the South.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing competition and rising costs of production ultimately strained the business and caused its closure in 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1955 to 1981, the Brewery housed A. Karchmer and Son Scrap Metals.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">In the early 1980s, the building came into the possession of Laurence M. Bloch and Alvin J. Lazarov, but the developers failed to renovate the building, and it fell into disuse. The dilapidated building caught the attention of the Memphis Fire Department in 1998, and the owners were sued for violation of an anti-neglect ordinance. The building sustained significant damage over the years, including roof damage, broken exterior masonry, and smashed windows. Environmental Court Judge Larry Potter ordered the owners to bring the Brewery up to code or risk demolition. The Brewery was saved in 1999 when Kevin Norman purchased the building and paid to get it up to code. Over the following decade, Norman tried and failed many times to redevelop the Brewery.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">An attempt made in 2006 reveals the importance of community input in the reuse of old structures. A group of developers planned the Tennessee Brewery Mixed-use Condominium and Retail Project which proposed a 14-story modern-style addition to the Brewery and demolition of much of the existing square footage. Although the project garnered support from some members of the City Council and neighbors of the Brewery, it drew heated criticism from the surrounding community as well as the Landmarks Commission. Citizens and the Landmarks Commission expressed concern about the Brewery being de-listed from the National Register of Historic Places if the renovation clashed with the Brewery&rsquo;s original Romanesque style. Residents and neighbors of the South Main Historic District formed Citizens to Save the Brewery in order to organize against the condo project. Ultimately, the redevelopment attempt failed due to the City Council&rsquo;s rejection of the plan&rsquo;s density variance increase. As a result, the Brewery remained vacant and undeveloped for the next eight years until another surge of citizen activism brought the Brewery back into public consciousness.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">In April of 2014, Norman announced that the building would be demolished if he could not sell it. The next month, restauranteur Taylor Berger, commercial realtor Michael Tauer, and communication specialist Doug Carpenter financed Untapped, a six-week beer garden held at the Brewery to demonstrate its lucrative potential and encourage likely buyers. This pre-vitalization effort was a great success. It served over 20,000 people and attracted cell tower developer Billy Orgel as a buyer. In August of the same year, Orgel announced plans for a mixed-use complex with 148 residential units and 16,000 square feet of commercial and office space. Orgel continued to cultivate public interest in the brewery project by holding a &ldquo;revival&rdquo; of Untapped the following year.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">This popularity persisted until 2017 when the Brewery Apartments opened and reached full occupancy within five months.

The Coliseum was operating at a loss at that time, and Shelby County refused to pay its 40% share of funding after 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, Memphis also made the decision to stop funding and to close the building.&nbsp;Additionally, the City of Memphis had been sued for operating several buildings, including the Coliseum, that were not ADA compliant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government ordered the City to either bring these buildings into ADA compliance or cease operating them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Coliseum, the city chose to close the building rather than make the needed renovations.</p><p>In 2010, a group known as Save the Coliseum formed and facilitated the initial dialogue between concerned citizens and the City of Memphis.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, the City of Memphis began to actively pursue funding to redevelop the Mid-South Fairgrounds, and this was to include funds to demolish the Coliseum.&nbsp;&nbsp;This specific effort to raze the Coliseum spurred the development of the Coliseum Coalition, which drew together a variety of individuals and organizations with an interest in saving the building.</p><p>The immediate goal of Save the Coliseum and the Coliseum Coalition was to prevent the demolition of the Coliseum.&nbsp;This goal was achieved in 2017, when the City agreed to &ldquo;moth ball&rdquo; the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preservation of the Coliseum was confirmed in November 2018 when the State Building Commission approved the City of Memphis&rsquo; Tourism Development Zone (TDZ) application for the redevelopment of the Fairgrounds as a Youth Sports Complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;A TDZ is&nbsp;a funding program for tourism attractions in a specific &quot;zone&quot; for which a baseline tax revenue is determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a TDZ is enacted, the increase in the tax revenue from the new / improved tourist attractions is able to be used to pay for the debt incurred to build the attractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The application that was ultimately approved, explicitly states, &ldquo;The Mid-South Coliseum and other historic buildings are preserved rather than demolished.&rdquo;</p><p>Save the Coliseum and the Coliseum Coalition have also brought the larger public to the Coliseum.&nbsp;In order to raise public interest in and excitement about the Coliseum, Save the Coliseum and the Coliseum Coalition has put on a series of annual &ldquo;previtalization&rdquo; events called Roundhouse Revival.&nbsp;&nbsp;Previtalization is the temporary activation of an inactive or underutilized space.&nbsp;This is a tactic that has been highly successful at other Memphis sites, including the Crosstown Concourse and the Tennessee Brewery. Since 2015, thousands of Memphians have attended the annual Roundhouse Revival (4,500 people attended the first event), on the grounds outside of the Coliseum.&nbsp;&nbsp;These events feature the three core &ldquo;brands&rdquo; of the Coliseum: music, wrestling, and basketball.fe()</p></td><td style=""vertical-align:top""><p><span style=""font-size:16px""><strong>Forces that led to change:</strong> &nbsp;competition, need for upgrades, city and county decision making, citizen activism (Coliseum Coalition)</span></p><table align=""left"" style=""width:45%""><tbody><tr><td>booklet(<img alt="""" src=""http://newmansmemphis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JO-Key-JO.jpeg"" style=""width:100%"" />,coliseumVideo)</td><td style=""text-align:center; width:50%"">booklet(V<span style=""font-size:16px"">irtual Walking Tour</span>,coliseumVideo)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",,,#A6800F,,,,,,,"-89.9804,35.1183,4",hide,,,

southmainInfo,booklet,,,South Main Street,"<p>Main Street developed as a result of booming railroad traffic in the early twentieth century. Manufacturing plants and distribution warehouses were drawn to South Main by the railway. Memphis&rsquo;s geographic location positioned it to become a center for railroad traffic within the United States. With the construction of Union Station in 1912 and Central Station in 1914, South Main quickly transformed from a residential area to a booming business center. The vast majority of buildings along South Main were built between 1910 and 1925 as a result of this boom. As of the submission of the districts National Register Nomination in 1982, all but a few of the 105 buildings on South Main were constructed between 1900 and 1930.</p><p>The 1920s were truly roaring for South Main as the district enjoyed its economic peak. By 1929, eight restaurants and eleven hotels had sprung up between Central Station and The Orpheum. South Main also became the main distribution center for MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, and other major film studios, which clustered along Second Street as part of &ldquo;Film Row.&rdquo;</p><p>Many prominent businesses cropped up on South Main, including Piggly Wiggly, Meyer Brothers Drug Company, Puck Brand Foods, United Warehouse, Memphis Brewing Company. These companies employed tens of thousands of people.</p><p>By the 1950s, however, diminishing railroad prominence in Memphis led to fewer customers and failing businesses on South Main. Union Station closed its doors on March 31, 1964, and the building itself was demolished in 1969 and transformed into a post office parking lot. Concurrent with the declining popularity of railroads, manufacturing in Memphis shifted from the city to eastern industrial parks, leaving large warehouses vacant and vulnerable to deterioration. The assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Lorraine Motel in 1968 and resulting civil unrest was the nail in the coffin for South Main. Even the Arcade Restaurant, which had operated 24 hours a day since its founding in 1919, closed. Blight engulfed the neglected area for the next twenty years. &nbsp;Redevelopment of South Main began in 1982 when Robert McGowan and Annie Mahaffey purchased 418 S. Main St. as their home and art studio. Robert lobbied the city for improved infrastructure and much-needed code enforcement to preserve the historic buildings on South Main. He also led advocacy efforts to get the South Main Historic District listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Consequently, developers began renovating many buildings on South Main, transforming them into art galleries, boutiques, restaurants, and loft apartments.</p><p>Shortly after McGowan&rsquo;s revitalization effort, redevelopment of Main Street began in earnest, and a public debate over the usage of full-sized buses on the Mid-America Mall quickly ensued, with many City Councilmembers, Mayor Hackett, the Downtown Neighborhood Association, and local citizens opposed to the idea for fear it would disturb the flow and feel of the Mall and surrounding residential area.</p><p>In 1989, the borders of the Downtown Neighborhood Association expanded to include South Main. In 1999, the Center City Commission selected Cooper Carry, Street-Works, Harold A. Dawson, and the Goodman Corps. to serve as consultants for the redevelopment of Main Street. Cooper Carry&rsquo;s plan for racial, gender, and occupational diversity on Main earned them leadership position in the consulting team.</p><p>Between 1995 and 2003, South Main experience a massive renewal. The renovation of eight warehouses and commercial buildings transformed South Main from a defunct industrial district to a center for innovation in art, food, and lifestyle. Local artists who lived and worked in the old buildings on South Main were key to the district&rsquo;s transformation.</p><p>From 2002-2003, South Main became the center of a number of public debates surrounding historic preservation, building demolitions, and redevelopment plans. Among them was the proposed demolition of four buildings on Main between Gayoso and Union, with the Landmarks Commission opposing demolition in favor of saving the Italianate architecture of 83 S. Main.</p><p>In 2003, the Omni Building, the first redevelopment project on Main, received a 16-year PILOT contingent on plans to transform it into three apartments and 3700 square feet of commercial space. That same year another project on Main, the W. T. Grant Building, received a 19-year PILOT to transform it into 15 apartments and 11,000 square feet of commercial space.</p><p>By 2014, South Main seemed to have fully embraced its new identity. According to South Main president Brian Douglas, &ldquo;South Main has evolved. Some call us the South Main Historic District. Some call us the South Main Arts District. Some combine it as the South Main Historic Arts District. We say South Main is legendary now. It&rsquo;s more of a destination. It&rsquo;s not just one thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, more than 2500 people live on South Main, drawn to the neighborhood&rsquo;s charm, walkability, and proximity to Downtown amenities. It is home to dozens of shops, restaurants, and creative organizations, all locally owned and operated. South Main has kept true to its origins by being a neighborhood built by those committed to the community. However, revitalization of the district is a work-in-progress with more than $200 million in new projects underway.</p><p>Ironically, South Main was saved by the very neglect that had rendered the district uninhabitable for businesses in the late 60s. Because no developers were interested in South Main for two decades, its many architectural gems live on. Nearly a century after their construction, the buildings on South Main look much as they did in the early 1900s comprising a wide range of architectural craftsmanship, including strong Beaux Arts, Georgian Revival, and Chicago Commercial style influences. As Robert McGowan noted in 1986, South Main is a &ldquo;uniquely intact stretch of small-scale period architecture.&rdquo;</p>",,,,50,,,,,,"-90.0518,35.1392",,,,
bealeInfo,booklet,,,,"<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Beale Street was established during the first half of the nineteenth century. During the 1840s, Beale Street was lined with large homes for wealthy whites. In the years leading to the Civil War, Beale became a commercial district for free blacks. Beale became a hotbed for African American land ownership, entrepreneurship, and community activity with the establishment of several businesses, and Freedman&rsquo;s Bank, and black churches after the Civil War. During Reconstruction, racist public accommodation policies further cemented lower Beale as a major commercial strip for black Memphians. The first half of the twentieth century saw Beale at its peak as it blended commercial spaces with entertainment venues and embraced ethnic minorities. Irish and Italian immigrants dominated ownership of businesses and saloons until the 1920s, when Jewish immigrants and African Americans also joined as property-owners. Greek and Chinese immigrants also found a home in the blended community on Beale Street.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">The environment on Beale also lent itself to the advent of blues. Known as &ldquo;the underworld&rdquo; during its peak, Beale welcomed a mix of pawn shops, cafes, dance halls, and theaters. Blues became popularized during the early 1900s by W. C. Handy&rsquo;s performances at Peewee&rsquo;s Saloon. Other popular clubs included the Monarch Club, the Panama club, and Hammitt Ashford&rsquo;s Saloon.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">During the 1930s, Memphis police began their crackdown on illicit activities, such as bootlegging and gambling, but Beale remained a popular entertainment district through the 1940s and 1950s, attracting musical talents like Elvis Presley, Sam Phillips, and B. B. King.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Beginning in the 1960s, however, Beale Street. began its long decline. As a target of contemporaneous urban renewal initiatives, Beale was slated for redevelopment as a suburban-inspired district. Federal funding was exhausted before redevelopment could fully begin. As a result, the forty blocks of Beale were reduced to just three. All businesses, with the sole exception of A Schwab, relocated or filed for bankruptcy. The remaining vacant buildings were boarded up and left exposed to vandals. The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 hastened this process, as both peaceful protests and reactionary riots drove whites out of the city and steered the private sector eastward. Amidst all this change, Beale St. received its National Historic Landmark designation.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">In 1969, Memphis Housing Authority (MHA), which signed an urban renewal contract in 1963, began clearing hundreds of Beale Street properties and nearby slum housing in an effort to transform the area into a major tourist destination. However, this type of urban renewal, which had already been discredited as a viable solution, further depleted Beale&rsquo;s vitality. At the start of MHA&rsquo;s project, 625 buildings stood on Beale Street. By 1979, only 69 remained, and over 1500 residents had been displaced. Officially, structural unsoundness was named as the primary catalyst for urban renewal, anecdotal evidence and racially coded language reveals that the desire to cater to white tourists also informed many of MHA&rsquo;s decisions. The Housing Authority&rsquo;s plan called for the hardware stores, liquor stores, beauty salons, and other businesses that would not appeal to tourists to be converted into nigh spots, restaurants, and curio shops. According to A. P. Johnson, the deputy director of MHA in the 1970s, MHA sought to build &ldquo;an area that would not be subject to the type of crime prevalent in those areas. It was felt people just wouldn&rsquo;t come to that type of area. For those reasons, the block immediately north and south of Beale were cleared.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">In 1973, after razing hundreds of homes and businesses, MHA sought bids from private companies to rebuild Beale Street.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">In 1977, the Division of Housing and Community Development created the Beale Street Historic Restoration Project to oversee the revitalization of Beale. The project was to include new construction, restoration, and public improvements, which necessitated the collaboration of local, state, federal, and private entities. The Beale Street Development Corporation (BSDC), a nonprofit corporation, was tasked with finding funds, locating tenants, and encouraging minority participation. The for-profit Beale Street Properties, Ltd (BSP). was tasked with managing tenant leases and developing new structures. The city itself was responsible for retaining ownership of Beale and monitoring development through the newly formed Beale Street Steering Committee. Despite these clearly defined roles, the project faced many difficulties caused by in-fighting and restrictions on money usage. Developers also encountered initial difficulties in garnering private support for the project. The effort to restore Beale, however, inspired Congress to support a bill naming Beale St. as the official &ldquo;home of the blues&rdquo; in December 1977.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">&nbsp;By the early 1980s, redevelopment of Beale Street. was still in flux. In 1980, BSDC executive director George Miller temporarily resigned after it was rumored that he was involved with BSP. This incited a heated debate about the competency of BSDC leadership, the involvement of African Americans in the project, and the role of the media in exacerbating tensions. Meanwhile, the city refused to request any more state funding for Beale until reliable leadership in BSDC was ensured. In 1981, Miller was fired after an investigation concluded that Miller was indeed involved in both the BSDC and BSP.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">In 1982, Elkington &amp; Properties, a private non-profit corporation, was chosen by the city to serve as the management and development company for Beale, which greatly streamlined the redevelopment process. Phase I of redevelopment began in 1983. It included the development of 87,000 square feet of restaurant, entertainment, and retail space. Developers also succeeded in gaining private investments in Beale. Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Holiday Inn, Malone &amp; Hyde, Plough Broadcasting Co., and Republic Airlines donated over $600,000 to the project. In March 1983, the new tenants of Beale were announced to include country blues singer Charlie Rich, Lou Rawls, and fifteen others of various ethnicities. The street reopened in September of the same year to much fanfare. Editorials praised it a symbol of racial unity and harmony.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Phase II of the Beale project, the redevelopment of an additional 100,000 square feet, commenced in 1985. However, the struggles of the previous year persisted. Although business tenants had been promised profit, many complained of increasing rent and expensive maintenance costs. Entertainers like Charlie Rich and Lou Rawls were supposed to supplement existing businesses with clubs of their own, but Rawls backed out, and Rich&rsquo;s club was delayed. By February 1985, six businesses had closed, while the remaining tenants possessed a debt of $500,000. In contrast to tenant frustration, developers Elkington &amp; Keltner remained optimistic about the future of Beale. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Elkington and Keltner also faced criticism from black leaders who worried that Beale&rsquo;s historic integrity as a center of black life would not be preserved in the course of revitalization. At a meeting for the Beale Street Community Forum it was agreed that all plans for Beale should retain cultural and historical authenticity, and input from black leaders and community members was sought.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">From 1986 to 1987, Beale Street faced the threat of losing its national register nomination due to the alteration and deterioration of too many structures. Ultimately, Beale&rsquo;s landmark designation also became integral to the success of its redevelopment. Ten years after initial doubt about Beale&rsquo;s historical integrity, the street was taken off the Park Service&rsquo;s endangered list.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Today, Beale Street is both a popular tourist destination and a celebration of Memphis history.</span></p>",,,,50,,,,,,"-90.0179,35.1239",,,,
