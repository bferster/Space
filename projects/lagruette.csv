His parents owned a store and Alex lived with his parents and younger brother in an apartment above the store. He attended school and his favorite subject was geography. Alex grew up in a Jewish family and he and his family were fairly religious; they attended synagogue regularly and celebrated Jewish holidays. When Alex was eleven years old, the Nazis annexed Austria. Soon, Alex was excluded from playing with some of his gentile friends and he faced discrimination in school.<p>As life in Vienna became dangerous for Jews, Alex's parents sent their son out of Austria in an effort to keep him safe.

About 134 of these children lived together at Château de la Guette, a Rothschild family estate outside of Paris that was turned into a children's home. While there, they had a vibrant educational and communal life.<p>Because of France's unique wartime context, the children were forced to leave La Guette and continue their migrations, first as a group and then as individuals or in smaller groups. The La Guette experience and community often reemerged as a source of stability, comfort, and companionship for the children during the war and into their adult lives.<p>This digital project traces the transnational journeys of the La Guette children as they fled persecution and searched for home. The map, timeline, and story pane highlight the general journey taken by the La Guette group as well as four individual journeys representing common paths taken by the children during the war:<p style=""margin-left: 20px"">1) Hiding in France for the duration of the war<br>2) Fleeing illegally over the border into Switzerland<br>3) Discovery and deportation<br>4) Immigration to the United States in 1941</p>Click through the pages of this project to learn more about the children's experiences and consider the impact of communal life in France on the children's lives both spatially and socially.<p>Sarah Schneider<br>M.A. in History Student<br>University of Central Florida<p>*Please keep in mind that specific dates on the map and timeline may be estimations given limited information in source materials.</p>mask(i-)</p>segment(6)",,,Story,,,,,,,,"6, 48.5, 4100",,,st1,"Image: Group portrait of Jewish refugee children at the Château de la Guette children's home.

The La Guette castle was converted into living quarters for the children and the home was run by educators who were caretakers and teachers for the children. Some of the original educators were involved in the Spanish Civil War and their democractic values informed the children's education. The children took classes and the educators especially emphasized learning French.

,,Off-Site Placements from La Guette,"There was a change in leadership at La Guette as a result of the outbreak of war between France and Germany in September of 1939; two of the educators were interned as enemy aliens and one educator was a French citizen who was called up to fight. As a result, a new directrice was put in charge of the home.<sup>1</sup><p>Following this change in leadership at La Guette, a group of approximately ten of the older La Guette girls was sent to a boarding school in Saint-Briac, located in Brittany. It appears that the girls were sent to a French school to improve their French language skills. However, the girls may have also been sent away because they rebelled against the new La Guette directrice. The girls in Saint-Briac were suddenly in a very different environment than La Guette; they had to adjust to a Catholic school that was run very strictly, as Erika Goldfarb explains in her oral history, ""...we were so unaccustomed to this type of discipline, you see the French discipline and the restrictions and so on, but we managed.""<sup>2</sup><p>Eventually, a group of boys was also placed in a French school, but in Clamart. La Guette child Heinz Low wrote in a diary entry on May 26, 1940 that he was at the school École des Jeunes Gens in Clamart, ""in order to learn French faster and to make the 'Certificat d'Études'. At first it was very hard on us because we were used to La Guette. Now we are much happier since in a few days we will depart for Po[i]tiers because it is too dangerous here as a result of the bombings. We received lots of mail from La Guette. During Easter we went to La Guette for five days.""<sup>3</sup><p>The children placed in Saint-Briac and Clamart later re-joined the La Guette group in La Bourboule.<p>mask(o-)</p>",,2,Story,,,,,,,,".5, 48.822070, 1100",,,st7,"<sup>1</sup><i>Les Enfants de la Guette: Souvenirs et Documents (1938-1945)</i> (Paris: Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine, 1999), 19.<p><sup>2</sup>Erika Goldfarb, interview 4024, <i>Visual History Archive</i>, USC Shoah Foundation, 1995, accessed March 1-3, 2017.<p><sup>3</sup>Heinz Löw's Diary, Ruth Salmon Seltzer papers, 2007.421, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Archives, Washington, DC.",

In May of 1940, the group fled to Hôtel des Anglais, a hotel building located in La Bourboule, a town in the Massif Central mountains. When the Germans occupied northern France, La Bourboule became part of unoccupied, Vichy France. There was a shortage of food during the children's stay at Hôtel des Anglais and some of the children looked for plants outside to assuage their hunger. The children were extremely cold in the winter due to the condition of the building and lack of heat.<p>Many of the La Guette survivors, including Alice B., reference the challenging conditions at Hôtel des Anglais: “But the problem with La Bourboule was that it was extremely cold. Even in the summer it was cool. And it rained a lot and the winters were just awful. And we had no winter clothes whatsoever and we were always freezing. And after the first couple of months there was no food, or very little. So all we ever thought about was food and warmth, and everybody developed chilblains.”<sup>1</sup><p>There was some interaction between the La Guette children and the Jewish community in La Bourboule. Some of the children had the opportunity to be a guest for a meal in a private home of a Jewish family in La Bourboule. La Guette child Gerhard Mahler had a bar mitzvah in La Bourboule and is pictured above with a family that hosted him for the occasion. Some of the other boys who turned thirteen also had bar mitzvah ceremonies in La Bourboule.<p>By the end of 1941, the children's home at Hôtel des Anglais was closed and the organization Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE) took over the care of the La Guette children. OSE is a children's aid organization that played a crucial role in rescuing and caring for children during World War II, including in OSE-run children's homes.<sup>2</sup><p>mask(a-)</p>segment(2)",,,Story,,,,,,,,"2.735155, 44.7, 3000",,,st8,"Image: Gerhard Mahler poses with the children of a family in La Bourboule who hosted his bar mitzvah.

However, they could send mail through the neutral country of Switzerland. A woman living in Switzerland, Elisabeth Luz (pictured above), forwarded mail for many of the La Guette children and their parents. The children called the woman ""Aunt"" Elisabeth.<p>Not only did Aunt Elisabeth forward mail, but she also often kept in contact with families of La Guette children as family members fled to other countries or were deported. Aunt Elisabeth notified La Guette children about the location of parents and reported when their mail was undeliverable. As time went on and the La Guette children themselves fled to different locations, Aunt Elisabeth sometimes kept in touch with them and knew about their whereabouts. Many of the children who fled to Switzerland listed Aunt Elisabeth as someone they knew in the country when they filled out questionnaires upon their arrival. As a result of Aunt Elisabeth's correspondence with La Guette children and parents she helped reunite children with surviving family members after the war.<p>mask(f-)</p>segment(2)",,2,Story,,,,,,,,"9.041111, 48.537778, 4000",,,st9,"Image: Two women work in a vineyard in Ebnet-Staefa.

Hôtel des Anglais was closed by the end of 1941 and the children remaining in France were sent to other locations. Oftentimes the children hid in other Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE) children's homes or in convents, churches, schools, or farms. As time went on, the children typically assumed false identities in order to hide that they were Jewish. Many were given false papers with a partially or fully fake name, and if the children's accents gave them away, they claimed to be from a German-speaking area of France that had been bombed.<p>The children's situation was precarious and many frequently moved from place to place. The children's movements were often coordinated by the OSE, which had an underground network of contacts that knew the whereabouts of the children and changed the children's placements as they enountered danger. At times, however, the children (by then often teenagers) themselves made decisions about when to go from place to place based on their intuition; this is how one La Guette child, Frederick, avoided a roundup. Oral history interviewees frequently discuss close calls that they experienced during this period.<p>Some of the older children joined the French Resistance and delivered supplies and communications, destroyed railroad lines, or otherwise sabotaged German efforts and aided Jews and Resistance fighters.

After the Nazi <i>Anschluss</i> of Austria in 1938, she could no longer attend her public school and instead had to go to a Jewish school. Additionally, her family's social interactions moved from public spaces, which became restricted, to the home. On <i>Kristallnacht</i>, Alice’s father was taken away with other Jewish men, though he was soon released because he was a war veteran. Unable to find another way out of Austria, Alice and Herbert's parents sent them on the <i>Kindertransport</i> to France in March of 1939.<p>Alice shares that while the trip to France was initially an exciting adventure, the reality of the situation soon hit her. Alice describes the sadness that she and other children felt while at La Guette: “Especially the less popular kids were very lonely and there was a lot of crying going on. And I didn’t realize how sad I was already then, I remember looking out the window for hours waiting for my parents to show up, coming up the highway – it was out in the country. And of course they never showed up.”<sup>1</sup><p>In May of 1940, Alice went with the other La Guette children to Hôtel des Anglais, where conditions deteriorated. However, Alice was one of the children who attended public school while living at Hôtel des Anglais, and as a result, she was in a heated room during the day. Going to the school also gave her access to additional food, as she explains, “And there were a number of Jewish refugees in town and one of the children always brought me…something to eat, a slice of bread or something. I guess they didn’t have all that much either but they had more than we did…”<sup>2</sup> Alice became more integrated in the La Guette group over time and she compares her peers to siblings: “I had friends, we were close by then, you know, the children. I had been with these children since 1939, so that was two years and they were more like siblings than strangers.”<sup>3</sup><p>In December of 1941, Alice was sent with other La Guette girls to Le Couret, an OSE home located in La Jonchère. Le Couret was a religious home, so the requirement to participate in services and other Jewish observances was an adjustment for Alice. The food availability and climate were better in Le Couret than at Hôtel des Anglais, but there was no running water and the home was crowded with children from various children’s homes and concentration camps.<p>From Le Couret, Alice was sent into hiding in Sèvres. She was among other Jewish children and teachers who lived under false identities in a <i>Secours national</i> home for children, as is pictured above. It was a risky hiding place because the <i>Secours national</i> program was under the leadership of Marshal Pétain, but the Jewish children's identities were never discovered. Alice says that she was lucky to be hidden at the site in Sèvres because she had access to food and other resources and she was in a good school.<p>When Paris was liberated in August of 1944, Alice and the other hidden children were able to once again assume their real identities. Alice stayed in Sèvres until March of 1945, at which point she went to a children’s home in Lyon run by Nathan and Hélène Samuel. She became very close with the Samuels and they helped her adjust to post-war life as a teenager. When Alice’s aunt and other relatives found out that she was alive, they made arrangements to have her join them in the United States. Not long before leaving for the United States, Alice found out from La Guette peers that her brother Herbert had died after being rounded up and deported, and she would later learn that both of her parents had also been killed.<p>After living in multiple locations in France for the duration of the war, Alice joined her relatives in the United States in 1946. She had a hard time adjusting to her new life in New York City. She says of this time, “…it was culture shock. The values were different, the language was different, the surroundings were different, the relatives were different, everything was different. And I always think of this period as the dark ages.”<sup>4</sup> She acknowledges how challenging it was for her and for her relatives to start a new life in the United Sates: “So it was very hard on them and it was very hard on me. They expected to have found a daughter and I expected to find parents and neither of us got what we wanted. But they were basically very good to me.”<sup>5</sup><p>After completing high school, Alice attended and graduated from Queens College. She met and married her husband soon after college and they had two children. Alice eventually settled with her family in Massachusetts. In addition to her undergraduate degree, Alice graduated from Boston College with a Master’s in French Literature.<sup>6</sup> Alice passed away in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2015.<p>mask(r-)</p>segment(6)",,2,Story,,,,,,,,"2, 47.5, 2200",,,st13,"Image: Jewish children in hiding study in a classroom of the children's home in Sevres.

After living at La Guette and in La Bourboule, Alex was sent to Nice with five other La Guette boys. Three of the boys, including Alex, attended a hotel school called École Hôtelière. As things became more dangerous for Jews in Southern France, Alex barely eluded arrest. He assumed a false identity and hid amongst Catholic children and a few other Jewish children at a church in Séranon.<p>Alex had to flee again to Lyon, where he was asked to lead a group of children across the Swiss border. He led the children across the border with the help of a <i>passeur</i>. However, individuals sixteen years old and older were turned away by Swiss officials, so Alex and a number of the other teenagers had to return to France. After a priest helped them get back to Lyon, Alex had his papers changed so that he could try to cross the border a second time. His birth month was altered so that he would appear to be under sixteen. He also had the first letter of his last name changed on his papers so that the border guards would not realize that he had already tried to cross the border. Alex made a second attempt to cross the border in September of 1943, and this time he was successful. He was accepted in the country as a refugee and was placed in a refugee camp in Vevey.<p>Alex then lived in a few locations in Switzerland, including at Hôme de la Forêt, an Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE) children's home in Geneva. He worked at the home and his job entailed purchasing supplies and planning meals.

,,Wartime Migrations: Deportation,"At least eleven of the La Guette children were arrested and deported. All but two of these children were killed.

The boys, Fritz David, Walter Loeb, Herbert Menkes, Georg Reichenfeld, Heinrich Rosenthal, and Ludwig Scheucher, were living in Brive-la Gaillard in Corrèze where they were attending the technical school École Pratique d’Artisanat Rural. The boys were sent to the assembly point of Nexon and from there sent to Drancy and deported on Convoy 26 on August 31, 1942. The convoy went to Poland, where some of the other deportees were sent to Auschwitz and the boys were sent to forced labor camps. Following their time in forced labor camps, Ludwig Scheucher (Louis Scott) was the only one of the six boys to survive.<p>Also on Convoy 26 was Ellen Rosen, a La Guette child who was deported and did not survive.<p>Not long after arriving in France, La Guette child Paul Stark left to go on the MS <i>St. Louis</i> to Cuba.

Louis was born in 1926 and grew up near Berlin. He was sent on the children's transport to France in 1939 and lived with the La Guette group in France at Château de la Guette and Hôtel des Anglais, and the photo above shows Louis with some of the other La Guette boys.<p>After living at Hôtel des Anglais, Louis was sent to the technical school École Pratique d'Artisanat Rural in Brive-la-Gaillard with eleven other La Guette boys. In August of 1942, he and five other La Guette boys who were sixteen or older were arrested in a roundup. They were among or arrested soon after ""the first children from the Unoccupied Zone to be handed over to the Gestapo by the Vichy government.""<sup>1</sup><p>Rather than being sent to Auschwitz, Louis and his five peers were chosen for hard labor in labor camps. Louis was sent to around twenty labor camps where he endured brutal work and living conditions. While in the labor camps he shoveled coal in coal mines, did welding and mechanical work in a factory, built roads, and did other forms of forced labor. At some of the camps he only recieved meager soup and a piece of bread to eat each day. The other La Guette children who were with him all died from disease, overwork, and/or malnutrition.<p>Louis was part of a death march in January of 1945. Amazingly, Louis survived the death march and was sent to the concentration camp Buchenwald. There, he was extremely sick and weak. For a time, Louis recieved food from a fellow La Guette peer, Alfred, who was imprisoned in Buchenwald for his work in the Resistance. Louis was able to survive until April of 1945 when the US Army liberated Buchenwald. When the camp was liberated he was emaciated. Louis was taken to Paris, and after a period of medical care he was able to recover.<p>Louis's father was killed in a concentration camp during the war, but his mother was freed and taken to Sweden as a result of the negotiations of Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden. Louis reunited with his mother in Sweden in 1946. After a while he returned to France, and from there he left for the United States in September of 1947 on a ship with other children. After arriving in the US, he lived in New York City, where he cleaned and repaired sewing machines. A few years later, his mother immigrated to the US and they lived together.<p>Louis moved to Macon, Georgia in 1951 for a job. Louis struggled in the segregated South, where he says that he ""learned what discrimination was for the second time around.""<sup>2</sup> Louis married in 1953 and eventually had one child. After a few years in Macon, Louis and his wife moved back to New York. For a brief period, Louis worked in Belgium before again returning to New York. He eventually moved to Miami, Florida, where he initially co-owned a bakery and later worked as a plant manager in a factory.<p>Louis was active in La Guette reunions and helped organize an OSE reunion in Miami. He also volunteered at the Miami Holocaust Memorial and the Holocaust Documentation & Education Center.

Thirty-five La Guette children immigrated to the United States in the summer of 1941 on two ships. The children were able to leave France due to the efforts of a variety of organizations including the OSE, American Friends Service Committee (Quakers), the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, HIAS, and the United States Committee for the Care of European Children.<p>Those children selected to immigrate to the United States went through Spain and Portugal in order to board a ship to the United States. During their journey to the United States, each child was given a nametag to wear in order to identify him or herself in case of emergency. La Guette child Kurt Moses's nametag is pictured above.<p>The first group of twenty-three La Guette children left with eighty-eight other children from other children's homes and concentration camps in France. All of the 111 children except for about five were Jewish. Dr. Isaac and Masha Chomski accompanied the children to the US. The group left Lisbon, Portugal on the SS <i>Mouzinho</i> on June 10, 1941 and arrived in the United States on June 21, 1941.

Due to the holiday, they could not leave the ship until the next day, September 2, 1941.<p>After arriving in the United States, twenty-five of the La Guette children who immigrated on the first and second transports were under the care of the US Committee for the Care of European Children. These children were sent to orphanages and/or foster homes throughout the United States. The ten other children came over under the sponsorship of a relative or other individual and would live with that person after arriving in the US.<p>mask(x-)</p>segment(2)",,,Story,,,,,,,,"-36.233647, 42.584719, 18000",,,st18,"Image: Identification tag issued to Kurt Moses by the American Friends Service Committee for his voyage to the United States on board the Mouzinho.

She enjoyed celebrating Jewish holidays as a child and walked with her family to synagogue regularly. In November of 1938 her family was forced out of their home in the Rhineland and she lived elsewhere in Germany before leaving for France in March of 1939.<p>Alice lived with the other children at Château de la Guette, where she remembers growing plants and vegetables in the garden. Alice also helped out in the kitchen and enjoyed helping the doctor take care of children who were sick. Alice moved with the group to Hôtel des Anglais in La Bourboule and lived there until she was chosen to go to the United States.<p>While at Hôtel des Anglais, Alice had the opportunity to visit her mother in the French concentration camp Gurs. Alice describes the visit to the camp by saying, ""I did not recognize my mother at all, and my mother kept showing me off to other members of the family and I was unable to recognize anyone. We spent a day there and so I was able to see what kind of food and how they lived at Camp de Gurs, which was terrible.”<sup>1</sup> By the time that Alice visisted Gurs her father had already died, and the trip to Gurs was the last time that Alice saw her mother.<p>In June of 1941, Alice left with 110 other children who were going to the United States, including twenty-two other La Guette children. She traveled with the children and adults through Southern France, Spain, and Portugal, and then left on the SS <i>Mouzinho</i> for the United States on June 10, 1941. Alice and the group arrived in New York City on June 21st and she stayed in New York City briefly before being sent to San Francisco. Alice lived in a Jewish orphanage in San Francisco before being taken in by a family that lived in Sacramento. She had a difficult time in her foster home because she did the majority of the housework and cared for the two other children in the household.<p>Despite her difficult living situation, Alice excelled in high school. She says she aspired ""to go into medicine, however, I was discouraged, one because I had no money, and two because I was female; in those days that was a big obstacle. The third, I had no family to support. So that was pointed out to me over and over again and since I – no one took the time to tell me that a full scholarship didn’t mean that I would have to pay. I chose not to accept them, neither Stanford nor Berkeley, because I was afraid I would be stuck and having to repay the...scholarship. So instead I did go to Berkeley, lived with a family for room and board.”<sup>2</sup> She then transferred to San Jose State University to study occupational therapy.<p>Alice had a long career in the fields of occupational therapy and rehabilitation counseling, first in Illinois and then for most of her life in California. She was close with her La Guette peers in Southern California and enjoyed organizing local gatherings. Alice describes her close connection to other survivors: ""Locally, we have about six of our brothers and sisters in the area, and we periodically meet. We chat frequently. It’s sort of a bond, a brotherly bond.""<sup>3</sup> Alice passed away in Long Beach, California in 2010.<p>mask(u-)</p>segment(2)",,2,Story,,,,,,,,"-55.7, 38.51, 17000",,,st19,"Image: Two uniformed Portuguese policemen stand on the pier in the port of Lisbon as a group of Jewish refugee children wait in line to board the SS Mouzinho.

Some were old enough to work, go to school, or fight in the military independently. Others were taken in by foster families or lived in children's homes until they were independent. Some children reunited with one or both parents during or after the war, but many of the children had one or both parents who were killed. Picking up relationships with surviving parents or other family members was sometimes challenging after many years of separation. Furthermore, many of the La Guette children immigrated to new counties and had to adjust to a new culture and language, sometimes for the second or third time.<p>Ultimately, the La Guette survivors carried on in their lives wherever they ended up. Many were happy and successful in their careers and while raising families of their own. Nevertheless, some survivors speak about the psychological effects of their childhood experiences and lived with the pain and trauma of their experiences in the Holocaust and World War II throughout their lives.<p>mask(q-)</p>segment(4)",,,Story,,,,,,,,"14.943367, 13.960984, 37000",,,st21,"Image: Peter Watkins greets his stepchildren, Gerhard and Sylvia, upon their arrival in Sydney.

Many of the children moved repeatedly and had to adjust to multiple placements and sometimes multiple cultural contexts.<p>La Guette child Gisela Edel’s map, pictured above, shows the many places she lived in France during her flight from Nazi Germany. Her map and other maps of the children's movements illustrate that being sent to France often resulted in continual flight from persecution; indeed, some of the children's movements are difficult to map in detail because they moved so often.<p>The spatial patterns of the La Guette children are very different from the movements of children fleeing on the <i>Kindertransport</i> to Great Britain because the La Guette children fled to a country that eventually faced German occupation. The memory of the <i>Kindertransport</i> should be expanded and complicated beyond the case of Great Britain to include the children who were sent to France and other countries.</p>mask(g-)<p>segment(5)</p>",,,Story,,,,,,,,"6, 48.5, 5000",,,st25,"Image: Page of a photo album showing Gisela Edel in the Couret children's home as well as a map in the shape of a Frenchman's face, showing where she hid during the war.

These communal experiences in France served as a source of stability for many of the children, and many of the La Guette children kept in contact with their La Guette peers, educators, and even members of the Rothschild family during and/or after the war.<p>The children's accounts of and references to Château de la Guette, Hôtel des Anglais, and their La Guette peers are often privileged in their oral history interviews. Additionally, the reunions of La Guette survivors, including one at Château de la Guette itself, demonstrate the importance of the place and community of La Guette in the children's lives. Reunions also helped shape collective memory of the La Guette experience.<p>The Château de la Guette case shows that children's homes for Jewish refugee children during the Holocaust often played a critical role in the children's social and psychological development in the midst of traumatic events. Furthermore, the Château de la Guette case demonstrates that transnational Holocaust survivor networks emerged from children's homes just as concentration camp survivors and other groups of Holocaust survivors formed survivor networks.</p>mask(g-)<p>segment(5)</p>",,2,Story,,,,,,,,"6, 48.5, 5000",,,st26,"Image: A group of Jewish refugee girls from the Chateau de la Guette OSE [Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants] children's home dance outside.
