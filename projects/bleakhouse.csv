s1,story,,,Arthur Jefferson,"Arthur Jefferson<br>c. 1808 - 1896<br><br>Margaret Wood, daughter of David Wood and Mildred Walker Lewis, was willed Arthur as part of her share of her father's property when he died in 1818. He was valued at $450 and his age was not listed. A year later, Margaret married James B. Rogers and Arthur came with her. In the census of 1820, Arthur appeared as the single male slave in their household. According to the census category he was in, he was less than 14 years old and was probably around twelve. In the inventory of 1863 after the death of James B. Rogers, Arthur, 60 years old, was valued at $800.<br><br>Immediately after emancipation, the Personal Property Tax records place him  living first with B T Brown, and then with Lucy A M Brown. In 1868 he owned two horses which were valued at $75 and a cow worth $25. He was very well off compared with many of the newly freed slaves who owned nothing. In the first census after Emancipation, he was living with his wife, Jane, and two children, Robert, born in 1851, and John H, born in 1865.<br><br>They were living next to Mariah Evans and her family, with whom he had been enslaved at Bleak House, and near Adam Whipps and his children, who had also been enslaved by Rogers. He appears twice on the 1870 census, both entries living next to the Evans family. His wife Jane and her two children had been enslaved by O G Michie, son of James Michie Jr of Longwood. Longwood shared a property line with the first home the Rogers family lived in in Earlysville.<br><br>Jane and Arthur Jefferson appear in the 1880 census but no children were with them.  Arthur was working as a  farm laborer. <br><br>In 1882, Arthur Jefferson bought a parcel of land for $125 from David and Liebchen Levine, recent immigrants from Germany. Seven years later, he gave a piece of the land, 20 by 30 yards, to Ada Becks, the daughter of John and Maria Becks. Maria's maiden name was Jefferson, and she may have been a sister of Arthur's. She had been enslaved on the plantation of Nathaniel Burnley. Thus, Ada may have been Arthur Jefferson's niece. Perhaps he was giving her land because he and Jane had no surviving children. In 1886, Arthur bought five more acres of land and Horace Solomon bought land from him off Hydraulic Road, where the Solomon Court Apartments now are. <br><br>Jane died in 1891, and Arthur reported it , indicating the horrific cause of her death as ""burnt."" <br><br>Arthur died before the 1900 census, after December 2, 1895 when a short story about him was printed in the Daily Progress.  In it he claimed to have ""reached one hundred and eleven years of age 15th of last May. ..He claims to have seen Jefferson for whom he was named… He belonged to Major Wood… The old man says that about a year ago some of his relatives tried to get him out of the way by stuffing bed clothes in the mouth with the hope of strangling him.  He says he awoke, however, and pulled the clothes out of his mouth, and ""dat de old man is here yet."" He claims to have had some money in bank (sic) which his relatives wanted to possess.""",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1170/5098334465_fd98930be4.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s2,story,,,Lucy Woodfolk,"Lucy Woodfolk/Woolfork<br>c. 1800 - 1870+ <br><br>Lucy Woodfolk appears on the Rogers’ inventory as 63 years old which would make her birth around 1800. Lucy may be the first female slave that the Rogers family acquired. The 1820 census shows a female between the ages of 14 and 25, which means Lucy could have been born between 1795 and 1806.<br><br>Lucy was a Wood, like Hannah Wood and Pricilla Wood, indicating that she had been enslaved by David and Mildred Wood.<br><br>She was the mother of at least seven children who were born into slavery while she was considered the property of James B. Rogers.  Her first child, Judy, born c. 1826, wife of Allen Reed, Cynthia, c. 1831, wife of Adam Whipps, Peachy, c. 1831, Sophia, c. 1833, wife of George Walker, and sons, Armistead, c. 1835, Nelson, c. 1837, and John, c. 1841. She may also have been the mother of Rose and Ellen. <br><br> Her husband was Armstead Woodfolk, who was most likely enslaved by Hawkey Ferguson.  Ferguson died in 1853 and a slave, Armstead, 52, valued at $500 is on the inventory of his estate. The Ferguson family lived near Free Union and their home was an early log structure also called Bleak House.  Elizabeth Ferguson had married Rogers’ father, Parmenas, after Frances Baber, James B.’s mother, died.  Parmenas and Elizabeth Rogers lived in a house called Willow Glen on the banks of Piney Creek, off what is now Catterton Road, between Earlysville and Free Union. It would not have been a difficult distance for Lucy and Armstead to navigate to be together, and after the Rogers moved to Bleak House, there is a road through the woods that still exists connecting the two properties.  <br><br> In 1858, the Rogers' daughter Margaret celebrated her marriage to William Overton Terrell at Bleak House. Margaret went to live with her husband at his home, Glen Echo, and took Lucy with her. In 1860, Lucy returned to Bleak House. Margaret had been attacked and almost killed by one of the Glen Echo slaves in 1859 and less than a year later she and her husband  fled from Albemarle County. The court records of the trial of the person who attacked Margaret Rogers Terrell describe Lucy as the slave of James B. Rogers, so she had not been officially given to Margaret and did not go with her when she left the county.  When Lucy arrived at Glen Echo there was an enslaved man, William Woodfolk, at the plantation, and there may have been a family relationship between them. <br><br>In the 1870 census, Lucy Woolfolk, 80,  Armstead Woolfolk , 78, and the younger Armstead Woolfolk, 33, had moved into Charlottesville and were living with the William Wertenbaker family. Wertenbaker was the university librarian and at this time he was building additional homes for his daughters on his property. Armstead Woolfolk, the younger, was a carpenter. With them is a child, Oscar Bruce, 8, who may be a son of a deceased daughter named Ellen who was one of the Rogers' enslaved who had been given to his daughter Martha Wood and her husband Dr. A. C. Wood.  Ellen gave birth to a child named Oscar and she had died in 1862. The Woodfolks may have been his grandparents and so may have become his caretakers at Ellen’s death. All of the family are described as mulatto.<br><br>Lucy and Armstead Woodfolk Sr do not appear on another census after 1870.<br><br>The Woodfolk name has many variants, Woodfork, Woodford, Woolfolk etc. and Lucy’s children are found with changing surnames on different documents.",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1434/5098217361_0bdf83f8a0.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s3,story,,,Adam Whipps,"Adam Brown/Whipps/Whips<br> 1827-1921<br><br>Adam was the son of Priscilla Wood and James Brown. Priscilla Wood was one of the dower slaves of Mildred Lewis Wood and appeared in the will of David Wood in 1818 as ""Siller"", age 28, with daughter Frances. Another of the slaves mentioned in Wood's will is called Adam. Perhaps he was Priscilla’s brother, and Adam Whipps may have been named after him, a common practice. Priscilla remained with Mildred Wood when Adam Sr. was given to Mildred's son, Robert Wood.<br><br>In an indenture dated 16 March, 1793, the slaves ""Jack and Siller his wife and 5 children, Jenny, Charles, Nancy, Grace, Wallace"" along with 3 other slaves, were sold to David Wood by his father-in-law, Nicholas Lewis for 239 pounds, 7 shillings and 3 pence. It is not known what happened to Jack or James Brown, Adam's father, but  Adam clearly stated his father was James Brown in his marriage certificate.<br><br>If Adam was given to Margaret and James B. Rogers by Mildred Wood before his mother Cilla went to the Rogers, then Adam was young, perhaps as young as 4. when he became one of this enslaved community. <br><br>Adam's mother Priscilla, (also called Ella, or Siller), joined the other Rogers slaves around the time of the death of Margaret Roger's mother, Mildred Wood. Mildred Wood died in 1836 and no slaves are recorded in the inventory of her estate, indicating that they had already been distributed.<br><br>When Adam was around 23, he began a family with Cynthia Woodfolk who had been born on the Rogers' plantation to Lucy Woodfolk and her husband Armistead, who was enslaved on neighboring Ferguson land. Cynthia and Adam had at least eleven children together. The first was Kitty born 1848. The second daughter, Fanny,  born 1849, was possibly named after Adam's sister Frances who appears in the 1818 Wood will.  Adam’s son Benjamin,  born 1851, appears as Bently on the Fiduciary Records of Rogers' estate. A daughter named Sally was born in 1855, but probably died before 1863. Their daughter Mary was born in 1857.  She was called Molly on the 1863 records. Lucy was born in 1859. She appears on the birth records as the daughter of Peachy. Peachy may have been a sister of Cynthia's and  Lucy may have been adopted by the Whipps family after Peachy's death, or the birth may have been incorrectly recorded. In either case, she would certainly have been named after her grandmother Lucy Woodfolk. Little Adam was born 1860, Warner in 1863 and  John W., was born in 1865 after Rogers died. He was probably named after Cynthia's brother John Woodfolk.<br><br>In the inventory of 1863-64 of the Rogers' estate, Adam was valued at $2200. He was 37 years old and worth less than those enslaved who were in their late teens and twenties. <br><br>In the 1870 census, Cynthia, Adam's wife, does not appear. Their one-year-old child, baby Cynthia Whipps, died of pneumonia in May of 1870 according to the mortality schedule. Adam’s wife Cynthia must have died in 1869 or 1870.<br><br>During the Civil War in 1862,  Albemarle County received an order from the governor to provide 540 male slaves between the ages of 18 and 45 ""to labor on the fortification around Richmond."" (Court Minute Book, 17, 1859-62)  Slaveholders were notified, and Adam was the slave chosen by Rogers to be sent. Adam would have been in his mid-thirties at this time. An item appears in the estate accounts for the costs of transporting Adam to Richmond.  Owners were paid for the work their impressed enslaved laborers were forced to do on behalf of the Confederacy, and so  the Rogers’ estate was paid $11 on March 26, 1864 for the labors of ""Negro Adam on going to work on Fortifications at Richmond.""<br><br>James B. Rogers died during the Civil War and in the account of sales of his personal property, Adam is one of three enslaved at Bleak House who made purchases when the contents of the house and farm were auctioned.  Adam bought a mirror and paid $2.00 for it.  <br><br>After emancipation, Adam Whips appeared in 1868 on the Personal Property Tax lists on the land of P. M. Davis, who was renting Bleak House and had been the overseer there. The next year, 1869, Adam was living on J. N. P. Michie land, Locust Grove, one of the Michie homes near Bleak House.<br><br>Adam seems originally to have gone by the name ""Adam Brown,"" "" Brown"" being the surname of his father. In the years 1866 and 1867, the name "" Adam Brown"" appeared on the Personal Property Tax Lists.  For these years, there is no listing for ""Adam Whipps.""  But in 1870, there is no ""Adam Brown"" on the census.  Adam had begun to use the surname ""Whipps.""  ""Adam Whipps"" and"" Adam Brown"" are almost certainly the same person. We do not know why he became Adam Whipps, but Adam did not use the name Brown after 1867.<br><br>In the census of 1870, Adam Whipps, mulatto, 45, is shown as head of household with his children Mary, 16, Lucy, 13, Adam, 10, and John, 5. The last person mentioned in the household is Nancy Michie, 75, who is White. They are living next to other former Bleak House slaves. Personal Property Tax records for 1870 show Adam had one head of cattle valued at $21.<br><br>Why was Nancy Michie not listed as the head of the household and the Whipps as subordinate? The Garfield Report to Congress from the Committee on the Ninth Census 1870 states, ""In order that a definite meaning may be attached to the term ""family"", it shall be held that the occupier of the whole or part of a house shall be deemed the head of the family, and that the term ""occupier "" shall be applicable to (1 a resident owner, or (2 the person paying rent whether as a tenant for the whole of the house, or (3 as a lodger for any distinct floor or apartment.""<br><br>Nancy Michie was an unmarried woman who had been living with her sister at one of the Michie homes near Bleak House called Chestnut Ave. It is unclear why she is shown living ""with"" the Whipps family, and not as head of the household. Perhaps the Whipps were living at Chestnut Ave and looking after the elderly Miss Michie. <br><br>In a list of pre- 1874 Black voters of Charlottesville, Va., Adam Whips, 48, is described as working as a ""wagoner"" and living on Barracks Road. Adam took his politics seriously and in 1889, when Redemption threatened to take away African Americans’ right to vote, he was involved in a dispute which was reported in the Richmond, VA Daily Times, November 8, 1889.  ""Adam Whipps, colored, was arrested for interfering with a colored man who was attempting to vote the Democratic ticket.  He took the negro’s ballot from him and forced him to vote for Mahone.  He will be tried tomorrow."" (Chronicling America, Library of Congress.) <br><br> A document from the papers of the Overseers of the Poor shows what kind of work Adam was engaged in less than a decade after he was freed. On May 26, 1873, Adam Whips received seventy-five cents ""to halling (sic) the corps to the grave."" The corpse was that of a man named Robert J. Wood. The entries on the paper above this one show that Dr McKey of the Poor House had commissioned a man named Dickerson to make the coffin for Wood, and had paid James Kelly $1.50 to dig the grave. ( Court Records, 1043182, Box #3, Albemarle County, Court Records, Misc., Library of Virginia, Richmond Annex).<br><br>Soon after Cynthia died, Adam remarried.  On December 12, 1870, he married Margaret Sims, daughter of Lucy Farmer of Greene Co. He was forty and his bride twenty-five. The couple were married by a White minister, Zachariah Wood, who was a neighbor of the Rogers, and they were married at Longwood, one of the Michie homes in the Earlysville area, next to the Pleasant Grove Baptist church where Zachariah Wood preached.  Adam Whipps' mother, Priscilla, had been a member of this church.  Adam and his family would have been well known to Reverend Wood.<br><br>Margaret Sims, or Margaret Gentry Whips as she is known in a 1940 court case, does not appear on the 1870 census, nor does her mother, Lucy Farmer. She and Adam had two children together, Rosa B. Whipps, born in 1872, and Lena Whipps, born in 1875. In November of 1876, Adam reported  Margaret's death from consumption. A month later, December 1876, Adam and Maggie’s son, Warner Whipps,  was reported dead from pneumonia. His age was given as nine. Warner was the son of Cynthia and Adam and appears as a baby in arms in the inventory of 1863. He did not appear in the 1870 census. If the child who died in 1876 was the same Warner, he would have been 13. If he were a child of Adam and Maggie's, he would have been around six, at most, but in either case he was one more of Adam’s children who did not live to adulthood.<br><br>After being widowed twice, Adam married for the third and final time in April of 1879. His chosen was Mrs. Phillis Ann Overton, born around 1844. Her maiden name was Simms, her parents Richard and Clara Simms. Adam and Phyllis would be together until their closely spaced deaths more than 40 years later. On the census of 1870,  Fillis Overton, 20 , appears living with June Dickenson, 65, and Jackson Payne, 44, a blacksmith and his family. She may have been boarding with them, or she may have been somehow related to them. She was illiterate, but working as a skilled seamstress.<br><br>After her marriage, Phillis took on raising Adam's young children by Margaret Whipps, Rosa, who was 7, and Lena, who was 4. In the 1880 census, they were living also with Adam’s daughters by his first wife,  Lucy, and her husband Josh Rives and their infant son and  Mollie and her husband Millard Thomas. All were living in the same house.<br><br> Phyllis and Adam had both become literate since the previous census. Adam worked as a laborer. Phyllis never had children of her own with Adam, but reported in the 1900 census that she had two children. She may have had children by her first marriage, or may have considered Rosa and Lena her own. She taught her stepdaughters to be seamstresses like herself.<br><br>The home where the family lived was at 337 Commerce St. and had been acquired by Phyllis Whipps in 1881. The family continued to own the property after Phyllis and Adam died and it was not sold until 1940.<br><br>In the 1900 census, Adam was working as a hotel waiter. He would have been around 75 years old. Phyllis was a dressmaker and so was her step-daughter, Lena Whipps. With them lived Mollie Thomas, now widowed.<br><br>In the 1910 census, Adam was not working, but Phyllis sewed professionally for a private family. Her step-daughter, Rosa B. Whipps, 30, had returned to her family after a divorce and reclaimed her maiden name. She was a ""tailoress"" at a department store. Lena Whipps, now 28, was a dressmaker working at home. Among the women, only Molly Thomas was not working, and was likely tending the house.<br><br>In 1920, Adam was 95 years old. Phyllis listed as 70, but was probably closer to 76. They were not working, but for the first time, Mollie Thomas was. She had a job as a nurse for a private family and the Whipps’ house also had a single lodger.<br><br>December 2, 1920, Phyllis Ann Whipps died, and two months later, February 1, 1921, Adam Whipps followed her to the grave. Both were buried by the J. F. Bell Funeral Home at Oakwood Cemetery in Charlottesville where an obelisk marker remembers their names.<br><br>Adam Whipps’ death certificate states that he had been working as a janitor, yet another job to add to the many he had worked at during his long lifetime. He had been under a doctor's care for a month during his final illness. The cause of his death is listed as ""apoplexy"" and it was reported by his son, John Whipps. Both Adam's parents were reported on the death certificate, so even sixty years after the end of slavery he had kept their names alive for his children. Phyllis Overton Whipps’ death was reported by her step-grandson who did not know her parents’ names, although they were known at the time of her marriage. She had not told her story, or her stepchildren and step-grandchildren had not listened.<br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/327CommerceSt.jpg)(327 Commerce Street, where Adam Whipps lived, Courtesy UVA Vinegar Hill Project)<br><br> pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/AdaWhippsMarker.jpg)<br>(Adam Whipps' marker, Oakwood Cemetery, Courtesy FindAGrave)",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1313/5098359825_082bffd1d7.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s4,story,,,Judy Reed,"Judy Woodfolk (Reed) <br>1826 - 1885+ <br><br> Judy was the daughter of Lucy and Armstead Woodfolk and the wife of Allen Reed. She appeared on the inventory of 1863 being thirty-five years old and described as ""unhealthy, "" but was valued at $1200, a considerable amount for a woman her age with health problems. This amount must include a consideration of her skill as a seamstress, a profession that is revealed in the 1880 census. Judy was the only female slave who bought items at the 1864 sale of the contents of Bleak House. With her skills she had earned her own money during slavery that allowed her to purchase a bedstead for $5 and a comb and brush for $2. <br><br>Judy and Allen Reed had at least six children. Two of the births were reported by J. B. Rogers, ""master"". In 1855, the birth of Ada F. was recorded, and in 1857, Billy was born. There is no Billy on the inventory, but there is a John Jr who was born in 1857 and is likely the same child.<br><br>Judy was one of the many children of Lucy Woodfolk. Her child,  John Jr, may have been named after John Woodfolk, her brother. <br><br> In 1847, when Judy was around twenty, her first child, Henry, was  born.  Her daughter Rebecca was born in 1849, Constancia in 1851, Elizabeth in 1852, Ada in 1855 and Billy (perhaps called John Jr.) in 1857. <br><br>Judy and her husband Allen suffered the loss of three of their children who were""given"" to members of the Rogers family. Henry was sent away when he was eight years old to be enslaved by Rogers' daughter Martha and her husband Dr. A.C. Wood. Rebecca was seven when she was sent to live in the household of  William G. Rogers, one of their sons. There Rebecca joined her uncle, her mother’s brother Nelson, who had been with W.G. Rogers’ family for six years, since he was 14.  He would have been around twenty when Rebecca arrived, and perhaps his presence would have softened her homesickness.  Seven years later, Rebecca’s sister,  Connie, or Constancia, then around 12, joined her there.<br><br>After emancipation, the Reed family reunited and lived together in a household located near Farmington, where Allen had worked since Emancipation. Henry had been away about ten years, Rebecca nine and Connie two. In the 1870 census Henry, 23, Rebecca, 21, Constancia, 19, Elizabeth, 18, and Ada, 15, were living at home with their parents, Allen and Judy, who both were 44. A grandchild, Alice Brown, was living with them.  Alice was the daughter of Abraham Brown and Constancia, or ""Connie"", who had married in 1868.  All were described as mulatto in this and the next census.<br><br>In the 1870 census, Judy was ""keeping house,"" as so many newly emancipated women were. Keeping one’s own house was a celebration of freedom, now, a woman did not have to work for anyone outside her own family, a role that had been impossible during slavery.   By 1880 she was working again as a seamstress. The Reeds had moved again, and they were living in Charlottesville in a large African American community probably near what is now Tonsler Park and the UVA hospital area.  They may have moved to be nearer their son Henry who lived on Main Street, but the work Allen Reed did as a gardener and Judy’s work as a seamstress suggests they may have still been working for one of the estates in the area. <br><br>Although described in the 1863 inventory as ""unhealthy"".  Judy lived at least 20 years more and made a brave move to Washington, DC, probably some time after her husband died in 1881. By 1885 she was identified in a Washington, DC directory as the widow of Allen. She lived there at 1906 K. St. NW, with her son Henry and his family, and her son-in-law, Lewis Rives and, perhaps, Rebecca, his wife and her daughter.  Her brother John Woodford, the most well-connected member of the Woodfolk family, may have helped both Henry Reed and Lewis Rives get jobs in government service.  <br><br> With her family around her, the sixty-something Judy Reed did something extraordinary after moving from Albemarle County. She applied for a patent.<br><br> Judy W. Reed had developed an improvement on a dough kneader and roller that would have been used to make beaten biscuits, a laborious and time intensive specialty item that was enormously popular in the South. To make this specialty, almost an hour of beating a dough made of flour, lard and milk with a mallet while folding and flattening the dough was required to create small air pockets that lifted the mixture when baked.  Before Emancipation, an enslaved cook would usually have made the time-and-energy consuming biscuits.  By 1885 a cookbook writer revealed that the biscuits had become a rarity because of the difficulty in making them. Machines did exist to speed up the process, but they were not common. <br><br>Judy must have seen, and used, one of these early roller machines, sometimes called "" biscuit brakes"", and improved on the design. Her patent application described  her invention:- ""A dough kneader and roller consisting of a wooden case or box containing a pair of corrugated intermeshing metallic cylinders or rolls...one being immovable laterally and provided with a crank to actuate the device and the other being movable, and a pair of plain rollers connected with one of the corrugated rolls by a belt, the case being divided..into two parts, the upper of which is provided with a hopper to receive the dough and deliver it to the rolls, and the lower forms a receptacle for the treated dough…"" The purpose of the box covering this device was ""to exclude dust..when a charge of dough is introduced it is kept clean during its passage through the rolls.""  The concern for solving the problem of keeping the dough clean reflects the realities of kitchens of this time with soot particles floating from open fires or wood stoves.  Judy Reed must have been cooking in such conditions, and making the biscuits for her employer, perhaps the Wood family of Farmington.<br><br> Judy Reed is among the first Black women, the third of only 4, granted patents for their inventions in the years after Emancipation before 1900. The difficulties she faced must have been ameliorated by the encouragement and support of her family, especially her brother, John Woodford, whose work in government service may have enabled him to connect with those who could help her.  <br><br> Applying for a patent at this time required a $35 fee and the expense of hiring a patent lawyer would bring the cost to about $100, a huge portion of the average income of the time.<br><br> The process to get Judy Woodfolk’s patent began with a filing on January 21, 1884.  Judy Reed’s lawyer, Edward J. Underwood, would have helped shepherd her patent through its early stages, but the inventor was always alone when examined by the patent officials during the interview process.  The patent was granted eight months later, one of the witnesses being Alice Underwood, the lawyer’s sister, who worked as a clerk in the Patent Office. Judy was illiterate, and signed the document with an X. <br><br>The patent, No. 305, 474, is dated Sept. 23, 1884. It was issued to J. W. Reed and as such is not obviously a patent issued to a woman.  Patent officials never recorded the race of those applying for patents, or their sex, but did issue a document yearly that gleaned women inventors’ names that were obviously feminine.  By using only her initials, Judy W. Reed’s patent was not included in the listing of women inventors for the year.  But someone was aware of the patent and two months after it was granted, Judy W. Reed was mentioned in a news item ""ABOUT WOMEN"" which appeared in a Santa Monica, California newspaper November 29, 1884.  The article describes four women patent holders and their inventions, one being ""Judy W. Reed, Washington D.C., dough-kneader and roller."" Her race is not noted; the item was newsworthy because she was a woman inventor. <br><br>  Judy Reed did not appear in any other city directory or on the 1900 census, and may have died soon after getting her patent.  However, the fame of her invention lived on, and in 1900, it was described for the first time among the inventions of other ""colored women.""   The American Citizen paper in Kansas City, Kansas, on Friday, July 6, 1900, included this story in a section called ""Race News"";-  ""During the last year patents have been granted to the following colored women- Miss Mary L. Benjamin, Boston, gong and signal chair for hotels, Sarah Good, Chicago, cabinet bed, Julia Terry, Lebanon, ILL, apparatus for holding skeins, Judy W. Reed, Washington, D.C., dough kneader and roller.""  In Indianapolis, the Freeman newspaper printed a similar paragraph about ""patents have been awarded to the following women of the Negro race…"" Someone was keeping Judy W. Reed’s name alive and connecting her with other Black women inventors of 15 years later. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/patent.png)<br><br>link(""Wikipedia article"",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_W._Reed)",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1186/5098226647_f24c19754a.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her mother was Lucy, enslaved by the Rogers, and her father was Armstead, enslaved by Hawkey Ferguson of Free Union. Her brothers, Armstead, Nelson and John, were born into slavery like she was on James B. Rogers' plantations. Judy and Sophia were her sisters, as Peachy, Ellen and Rose may also have been.<br><br>Cynthia became the wife of Adam Whipps, another of Rogers's enslaved workers, probably around 1847 when she was about 16. Cynthia and Adam's first child, Kitty, was born around 1848. The next daughter, Fannie/ Frances, was born in 1849, Benjamin, in 1851, Frank, in 1852, Sally, in 1855, Molly/ Mary, in 1857,  Adam, in 1860, Warner, in 1862, John W., in 1865 and little Cynthia in 1869. Two of these children were ""given"" to the Rogers' daughter Martha and her husband Dr. A. C. Wood, Kitty in 1856 when she was 8, and Fannie in 1863, when she was 15.<br><br>Lucy Whipps, born in 1855, may have been an adopted niece. Her mother was recorded as Peachy, but Lucy appeared as Lucy Whipps, 13, in the 1870 census. She listed her maiden name as Whipps when she got married and her parents as Adam and Cynthia. Perhaps, Peachy was Cynthia's sister and died soon after her birth and baby Lucy was then adopted by the Whipps.<br><br> Cynthia's namesake daughter died when she was a year old of pneumonia in May 1870. The elder Cynthia died before the 1870 census when she was about 38 years old, perhaps in childbirth.  Her husband was left with five young children to raise, and seven months after the death of baby Cynthia, he remarried.<br><br>The Whipps children that Cynthia bore, did not forget her. In a twentieth century chancery case dividing the estate of Adam Whipps and his third wife, Phyllis, Cynthia’s children were careful to name her as their mother.",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1208/5099021289_b99b9839e6.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rogers only because of her presence on the birth and death records in her role as mother. <br><br>In 1852, a baby, James, died of dysentery and  Rose is listed as his mother. In 1855, she gave birth to a daughter who is named Everlina on the birth register. This is probably the child Cornelia who appears eight years later in the 1863 inventory.( The names Cornelia and Evelina are both associated with the residents of Longwood, a Michie family home which adjoined the Rogers’ property before their move to Bleak House.) In 1858, another son of Rose's died, also of dysentery, six year old Nelson. He would have been born the year his brother James died.<br><br>Rose does not appear on the 1863 inventory or on any death records, but Cornelia Bibb, who is her probable daughter, appeared on the 1870 census living with Edmund Murray.<br><br>Because one of Rose’s children was named Nelson, she may have been a Woodfolk and may have named her son after Nelson Woodfolk, who would have been her brother. If this is the case, she would have been one of Lucy and Armstead Woodfolk's many children.<br><br>Strangely, the children of two mothers shared the surname Bibb when they lived with Edmund Murray in the 1870 census. Isaetta and Mary Ann, both children of Peachy, are named Bibb, as well as Cornelia, Rose's daughter. Perhaps Rose and Peachy married brothers.<br><br> Unanswered is - why was Edmund Murray taking care of these motherless children after Emancipation?",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5063/5617158822_e86ec9bb9b.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She must have died during this chaotic 7 year period and her death not recorded.<br><br> At Rogers’ death, Peachy was valued at $2200 with her baby, Mary Ann. They were valued together, the baby being considered too young to be separated from her mother.  Peachy appears in the birth register in 1855 as the mother of Lucy, and in 1857 as the mother of Abram. Iritta/Isaetta/ Iretta, 4, in the 1863 inventory, is also her daughter.<br><br>In 1870, Isaetta, 11, and Mary Ann, 5, were living with Edmund Murray, 52, in Fredericksville Parish, Albemarle County. Both young girls were working as domestic servants. Murray had been enslaved by Warner Wood’s family and after Emancipation Murray worked for both the Woods and the Brown family of Brown’s Cove, where his wife, Theodocia, lived. <br><br>On  January 4, 1875, Isaetta had turned 16 and married Scott Childress, a farmer. She said her parents were Jno (John) and Peachy and her surname was Bibb. By the 1880 census, Scott and Isaetta had two children, and Mary Ann Bibb was living with them, identified as Scott's sister-in-law. Isaetta and her sister Mary Ann had clearly stayed close to each other in the difficult years after Peachy had died leaving her small daughters.<br><br>It is unclear why Peachy's children were living with Edmund Murray after her death. Murray was also caring for Cornelia Bibb, who was not a child of Peachy's, but the daughter of another deceased Bleak House slave, Rose. Perhaps Peachy and Rose had both married Bibbs, or their children’s father may have been the same man. <br><br>Lucy, who was born in 1855 to Peachy according to the register of births,  was raised by the Whipps family.

The Ferguson lands were near the Bleak House property, and there is a road trace which still goes through the woods from one to another. After emancipation, Armstead Sr. continued to live with the Fergusons in Free Union. Armstead Woodfork, Jr, appears in 1868 on the Personal Property tax records living on the land of Robert Rodes.<br><br>In April 1869, Armstead Woodfork, Jr., filed a complaint against Thomas W. Wood who had not paid him for work done in 1868 building a corn crib. Armstead Woodfolk was owed $74.55 and he went to lawyers Fishburne and Carrington to help him press his case. Armstead was asking for $125 in damages. The case was dismissed in May with costs directed to be paid by Wood.<br><br>In 1869, Armstead moved to live on the property of William Wertenbaker, who was the librarian for the University of Virginia, appointed by Jefferson in 1826. His home, Wertland, was located in Charlottesville. Wertenbaker built two homes on his property for his daughters, and Armstead would have been helping with their construction.<br><br>The census of 1870 shows the Armstead Woolfolk family together, perhaps for the first time ever. Armstead Woolfolk, 78, Lucy, 80, and A. Woolfolk (Armstead jr,) 38, carpenter, all mulatto, were living with William Wertenbaker and his wife, Louisa, the Wertenbaker’s daughter, Francis Vandergrift, a postmistress, and several others, including a M. Woolfolk, f, 33, domestic servant, and Randolph Woolfolk, 19, who was attending school.<br><br>  Armstead soon moved to Washington, DC, where he was listed in a 1873 directory living at 1125 6th St., N.W. and working as a stonemason.  By 1880, Armstead Woodfolk had moved in with his brother John Woodford who had moved to Washington DC before 1870. Armstead, 45, and his wife, Mary, 37, appear on the census living with John and his wife, Hattie. Armstead stated that he had not worked for 6 months of the year, which may have reflected the difficult situation that propelled him to move in with his brother. Mary, his wife was born in Virginia and probably is the M. Woodfolk, 33, on the previous census living with him at the Wertenbakers. Mary was working as a servant and Armstead as a brick mason. Armstead was a skilled craftsman adept at carpentry,  brick work and stone masonry, skills he would have used to help to build Bleak House for the Rogers in the 1850's. Both Mary and Armistead are in an 1885 Washington DC directory, he working as a carpenter and she as a cook.<br><br>In 1900, Armstead Woolfolk shows up again on the federal census living in Washington DC, a boarder, in Jackson Alley. Jackson Alley was located in an area of Washington called Swampoodle, a black enclave in a poor Irish immigrant neighborhood. It was not an alley, but a wide street of homes ""built in a hurry to house emancipated slaves after the Civil War. Almost all the houses had dirt floors, no water, heat or lights and sewers that didn't run to that part of the city.""(whenwashingtonwasirish.blogspot.com/2010/11/swampdoodle.html-- April 20, 2011). Jackson Alley was described in an oral history of the area as a ""classic example of a notorious Negro shanty in the heart of Swampoodle."" The area was also ""a drawing point for malaria and other water and airborne diseases. It was very polluted..."" (Pat Lally, oral history interview, Feb. 9. 2011, a Historical Study of Near Northeast Washington DC, Boyd and Ball Consulting for the H St Community Development Corporation, July 15. 2001, hstreetcdc.org/documents/HistoryNearNEDC.pdf-- April 20.2011)<br><br>Armstead was working then as a carpenter, although he had not worked for 6 months of the last year. He reported that he was widowed. However, in the 1900 census, there is a Mary"" Woodfalk"", born in 1849, living in Washington, DC, who lists herself as married 3 years, but the numbers are crossed out. She says she has two children but none are with her. This may be his wife and they may have become estranged, perhaps because Armistead was a gambler, and had been in trouble with the police.<br><br> In 1884, Armistead Woodfolk was arrested for running a ""policy organization,"" a kind of numbers game, with headquarters at 12114 H. St. (Evening Star, June 4, 1884) Six years later, the same Detective Block arrested him in another policy operation, where he was working as a ""writer."" (Evening Star, April 5, 1890)  Armstead Woodford’s death was reported in the Evening Star the day after  Christmas, 1905.  He was 71 years old. <br><br>The Woodfork name is spelled differently in different documents. Armstead appears as Woodfolk/ Woodfork and as Woodford when living with his brother John. John consistently spelled his name Woodford, but was the sole member of the family to do so.",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5625002163_95c6d1eec5.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s9,story,,,Nelson Woodfolk,"Nelson Woodfolk<br>1835- 1892+ <br><br>Nelson Woodfolk (variant Woodfork) was the son of Lucy and Armstead Woodfolk.  He was one of the first enslaved children that James B. Rogers ""gave"" to his son, William G. Rogers, after William married Marion Wood in 1849. A year later, Nelson, then 14,  was ""given"" to the newly married couple. Another child, Eliza, who was 8, went with him. They would have gone to live on the property Rogers had bought from his son-in-law, Dr. A C Wood, to give to Dr. W. G.Rogers.( All three men were doctors.)  Later, Nelson and other of W. G. Rogers’ enslaved workers would move to the home he had probably been born in, the Rogers residence adjoining one of the Michie homes, Longwood. This home became W. G. Rogers’ after James B. Rogers moved from there to the newly completed Bleak House around 1854.<br><br>After Emancipation, Nelson Woodfolk appeared on the Personal Property Tax Lists living in 1867 on the land of B.F. Davis, which adjoined Bleak House land. In 1869, he was living on the land of L.A. Michie near Free Union. The 1870 census shows that his home was near Hawkey Ferguson’s where Nelson’s father, Armstead, had been enslaved.<br><br>Around the time Nelson was living with B.F. Davis, he began a family with Celista, also written as Selest, Lista, or Celestia. In the 1870 census, Nelson and Celesta were the parents of Mary, 3, and an infant born the year before. Nelson Woodfolk was 35 years old and Celesta, 28. Nelson worked on a farm, probably doing the same work he had done since he was a child.<br><br> Free Union’s doctor at this time, Dr. Thomas M. Dunn, mentioned  Nelson Woodfolk as ""former slave of Dr. James B. Rogers"" in his medical ledgers (Special Collections at U. VA.)<br><br> In March of 1876, Celista Woodfolk made the painful, but, required official report of the death of a baby she had lost when it was only a day old. Most often the father reported official news like this, so it may be that Nelson had left town before the baby was born. By 1880, Nelson Woodfolk had gone by train to Iowa and was working as a servant for John W. Jones, at the Des Moines Mine in Mahaska, Iowa.  Jones was the ""Superintendent of Coal Dump"" there. Nelson had left his family behind while he started a new life in Iowa.  In the same 1880 census, we see Celesta had left rural Albemarle county and moved into the city of Charlottesville with her three children.  No occupation is given for her in the census, so one can hope she was receiving money to live on from her Iowa-resident husband.<br><br>By 1885, Celesta and the children had taken the long train trip themselves to Iowa and had joined Nelson.  An Iowa census taken in that year places Nelson, 47, Selesta, 30, Mary, 16, Julia, 15, and Elizabeth, 10 in Harrison, Mahaska, Iowa.  Nelson was working as a coal miner, joining many other African American Virginians who had emigrated to work in Iowa’s mines.<br><br>A baby, Ellanora, was born to Celesta and Nelson Woodfolk in December 1885, but she lived only two months.  Her gravestone is in the Muchakinock Cemetery, Oskaloosa, Mahaska County.  It is a fine marker, beautifully carved with the inscription, ""Oh weep not for the loved one so rudely from thee driven, tis but a flower too good for earth transplanted into heaven."" (Find a Grave Memorial 128047910).  Less than a year later, January 30, 1886, baby Ellanora’s much older sister, Mary, then 18, died.  She, too, is buried in the Muchakinock Cemetery.<br><br>  Julia, the middle sister, met her husband-to-be in Iowa.  Caesar A. Gilette, son of Moses and Jane Southall Gilette of Albemarle county, had gone to Iowa to become a miner.  At the end of January, 1890, Julia, then 20, married C. A. ""Gillett"", 22.  Perhaps the parents of the bride and groom had known each other in Virginia, but certainly their children’s early experiences growing up in Albemarle would have made for a strong understanding between the newlyweds.  But this marriage was to end tragically, first with the death of young Gilette, and then, less than three years after the wedding, the death of Julia, on October 3, 1892.  Both Gillette and Julia died of consumption.<br>Julia’s tombstone (Find a Grave Memorial 128048370) shows a hand holding a book.  It identifies her as the wife of C. A. ""Gilett"" and notes she lived 22 years, 8 months and 22 days.  The inscription reads, ""We’ll join thee in that heavenly land no more to take the parting hand.""<br><br>Nelson Woodfolk’s heart was to be broken again, for only three days later, on October 6,1892, his wife Celestia died, also of consumption. The inscription on her grave reads, ""She was a kind and affectionate wife, a good mother and a friend to all."" (Thanks to Carl Nolan of Find a Grave in Iowa for re-photographing the gravestone so the inscription is legible.) <br><br>Nelson’s daughter Elizabeth, called Lizzie, also was ill.  Two years after her mother’s death, Lizzie, dubbed ""Lady Lizzie"" in the local press, was planning to go to Colorado to ""improve her health."" She left for Denver on December 21, 1894.  A newspaper account says ""many friends"" were there to see her off.  ""Everybody who met her loved her.  She was a girl of a sweet amiable disposition, and well qualified socially, morally and intellectually, the light of their home.  She has gone to restore her health and we hope she will find the balm that will give her relief from that hydra-headed monster, consumption,"" (Iowa State Bystander, Des Moines, IA, Fri, Dec. 7, 1894).  A week later, Lizzie returned, because, the paper reported, ""the atmosphere was too light. She is very ill."" A week after that, she died.  The funeral, according to the Iowa State Bystander, was ""largely attended.""  Lizzie had ""touched the hearts of many…""<br><br> How did Nelson survive these crushing losses?   No record telling the story of his life beyond these sad events has been discovered. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/CelestiaWoodfolk.jpg)(Celestia, Nelson Woodfolk's wife's marker in Muchakinock, Iowa, photo 28759253 by Carl Nolan)",http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/5166713227_d702c43579.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s10,story,,,Angelina Burleigh,"Angelina Evans((Burley Burleigh)<br> 1837 - 1924<br><br>Angelina may have been Mariah Evans’ first child. She was born around 1837, probably soon after Mariah and her mother Hannah were "" given"" to the James B. Rogers family by Mildred Wood, Margaret Rogers' mother. Mildred died in 1838 and her slaves had been given away by the time of her death. It is reasonable to assume that Mariah met Angelina's father soon after she became part of the Rogers’ enslaved community.<br><br>Oral history for the Evans family says Mariah's children were fathered by her owner, James B. Rogers, but it includes the possibility that she had children by someone else before she became Rogers’ ""companion"" or mistress. That person may have been Perkins Evans who was a blacksmith at James Michie Jr's Longwood plantation which adjoined the land the Rogers lived on until the 1850's. Perkins may have fathered the first two of Mariah's children, Angelina and Robert. They were not among Mariah's children remembered in Evans oral history, and it was with Perkins Evans that Mariah lived after Emancipation.<br><br>Angelina appears on the Bleak House inventory of 1863 as a 26 year old with a baby, Ann Maria. They were together valued at $3000, more than the other two women with young children. This may be a reflection of her age, 26. The other women with babies were older, 30 and 32.<br><br> Angelina had begun her family with Charles Preston Burley in 1858 or before, and they were the parents of baby Ann Maria and Josie, who was 4 in 1863. Charles Burley and his brothers, Hardin and George, had been enslaved by Garrett White, and at White’s wife's death in 1857 had been divided among Garett's children, Charles going to John White. In 1867, Charles was living on the land of Joe Perkins, but by 1868 Personal Property Tax records show Charles Burley was living at Longwood, the Michie land next to the Rogers' house on Buck Mountain Road. John White may have leased or sold Charles to the Michie's, because Angelina and Charles had a relationship that predated emancipation by 6 years. In 1869, Charles was in Earlysville. Reflecting the location of the different White family members who had inherited them, Charles' brother George was on William Minor's land, Gale Hill, in 1869, on J. H. Burnley's land in 1869. His brother Harden was with James Bragg in 1867, and at Ferneyhoughs Mill in 1869. George, Angelina’s brother-in-law, was the father of Jackson Price Burley, an important early educator in Albemarle County.<br><br>By the 1870 census, Charles and Angelina had four children, Robert, born in 1866 and Charles, born in 1868, joining the two girls. They were living near other former Bleak House enslaved, Angelina’s mother, Mariah Evans, Adam Whipps, and Kittie Ray, Adam Whipps’ now-married daughter.  Charles was working on a farm. By 1880, Charles and Angelina had left the farm and had moved into Charlottesville. Here they lived next to Janetta Golden Dabney who had likely been a slave of university professor Schele de Vere, and Chapman Michie, who was a shoemaker. Charles was a cook in a hotel, Angelina worked as a washerwoman, and their daughter, Ann Maria, now known as Maria, was working as a chambermaid. Only young Maria was able to read and write. The family had a new member, Price, who had been born in 1871 and was now 9. He was named after his aunt, Lucy Burley, George’s wife, who had been Lucy Price. She had also named her own son Jackson Price. However, Charles Jr, is not on this census and may have died. Josephine is also not present in the household, having married around 1878.<br><br>In 1900, Charles and Angelina were still living at 329 12th St in Charlottesville, and Charles was working as a day gardener. He reported not having been employed for 7 months of the last year. Angelina told the census taker that she had had 9 children and only 5 were alive. Calvin, now 18, still lived with them and worked as a waiter for a family. He had been named after Angelina’s brother Calvin Evans. Calvin Burley had been unemployed for 8 months. Angelina was not working. The family continued to live at #329 but the name of the street was listed as Garfield Hill in the 1910 census. In the 10 years that had passed, two more of Angelina's children had died and she reported only 3 were still alive. One was Calvin who, still single, lived with them. The others were the two married daughters born into slavery at Bleak House. Both Calvin and his father worked at odd jobs and the house was noted as rented.<br><br> In 1920, all of the living children had returned home to live with Charles and Angelina who were then 80 and 81.  Josephine Cobbs, 56,  and Maria Maupin, 54, were both widowed and Calvin remained single. No one in the family has a job. No one knew if the house was owned or rented. The Burleys said they had been married 50 years, but in actuality they had been together closer to 60.<br><br>In 1922, Charles Preston Burleigh died. He had been seen by the doctor the day before his death. His age was reported as 86. He was noted as having been born in Earlysville and his father's name as Charles Burleigh, Sr. The name of his mother was not known. His daughter Josephine, their first child, reported his death and said he was a retired blacksmith, although it is not clear that he ever practiced as one. He was buried by J F Bell Funeral Home in the Daughters of Zion Cemetery in Charlottesville.<br><br>Angelina survived her husband by two years and died in November of 1924. She was listed as 92, but was probably closer to 87.Her occupation was listed as that of retired cook. Again, Josephine reported the death to the authorities and carefully noted that Angelina's mother's name had been Maria Wood, who had been born in Albemarle County, and her father, Perkins Evans, had been born there, too. Angelina was buried at Oakwood Cemetery by J F Bell. She is probably buried near her husband in the Daughters of Zion section of Oakwood, known as Society Cemetery. The records of her death did not get into the J F Bell database, and the death certificate is incorrectly indexed in the microfilm guide. Angelina was not remembered in the oral history of the Evans family that was passed down through Calvin Evans, although one of her children had been named after him. <br><br>A note with the J F Bell Funeral Home records says the correct spelling of this family's name is ""Burleigh"", but it appears on census records as Bailey or Burley.<br><br>Angelina Burleigh's death certificate is 24169, registration district 2010, city of Charlottesville, Va. The certificate was filed November 25, 1924, the day she was buried. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/unknownmarker.jpg)(Angelina Burleigh and her family are buried in Daughters of Zion Cemetery, Charlottesville, VA.

s11,story,,,Henry Reed,"Henry Daniel Reed<br>c. 1838 - 1900+<br><br>Henry Reed was the son of Allen and Judy Woodfolk Reed. He was born around 1838 and ""given"" in 1845 to the Rogers’ daughter Martha and her husband, Dr. A. C. Wood. He was 8 years old, the age at which a slave child was expected to be able to work enough to equalize the costs of his keep. The A. C. Wood family lived in the North East section of Albemarle County, some miles from the Rogers home, in the area which is now Hollymead. In 1850, the Woods owned 11 slaves and there were five more by the 1860 slave census.<br><br>When Emancipation came in 1865, the Reed family would have been reunited with three of their children who had been"" given"" away to Rogers’ children. In the 1870 census, the entire Reed family was able to once again live together. Henry was listed as 28 on this census, and was working as a cook.<br><br> Four years later, on September 22, 1874, he married Mary A. Sellers, daughter of John and Almira  Sellars of Albemarle County.  Henry first moved to Richmond VA. where he had worked as a grocer, but by 1880 he and his family were back in the Charlottesville area, living on Main Street in an area of prosperous and prominent African American families. This area included families of Free People of Color such as the Robert Scott Sr. and Jr. families who had lived with an uneasy and fraught freedom before Emancipation.<br><br Mary’s father, John Sellars, was a successful shoemaker in Charlottesville, and the Reeds lived next to him and his family which included two teachers and a merchant. Mary’s grandfather, a ""minister of the gospel"", lived with her family.<br><br>John Sellars,  had sent his children to the early Freedman Bureau supported school that was run by Philena Carkin. Carkin remembered Mary's brother Robert with affection and wrote about his extraordinary good humor in her ""Reminiscences of My Life and Work among the Freedmen of Charlottesville Virginia."" Robert became a teacher in Boston, his brother Joseph taught in Keswick, and another brother, Tilly, taught in Charlottesville. Tilly's letters to Miss Carkin after she left are extensively quoted in her reminiscences. In 1886, he wrote to Carkin that ""My sister's husband is in the service of the government of Washington."" This would have been Henry Reed, Mary's husband, who was listed in an 1889 government document as working as a park watchman for the War Department, and earning $660 a year. His uncle, John Woodford, the first of those once enslaved at Bleak House to move to Washington, DC, may have helped him procure this plum job. Henry’s first appearance in the DC directory is in 1884, and  by the next year, 1885, Henry Reed, his mother, Judy, his sister, Elizabeth, and his brother-in-law, Lewis Rives, were all living together at 1906 K. St. NW.  <br><br>  Henry and Mary Reed were in the 1900 census living in Washington DC. Henry worked as a plasterer.  They had 4 sons, Robert, born 1879, Arthur, born 1885, Joe, born 1887, and Alanzo, born 1876. Alanzo was married to Nannie, born 1882, and all had been born in Virginia. Two of the children had been named for Mary Sellars' brothers.<br><br> Something caused Henry and Mary to leave Washington, DC after this census, for Henry died in Pittsburgh, PA, on July 7, 1902. He is buried in Homewood Cemetery. His wife’s sister, Nannie Sellars Byars, lived in Pittsburgh and in 1908, Mary Sellars Reed died, and her sister reported her death. Mary Reed is buried in the Uniondale Cemetery there. <br><br> During his lifetime, Henry Reed had been taken from his parents as a young child to live at the plantation of Dr. A. C. Woods, had returned and lived with his parents after Emancipation in their home near Farmington, had gone to Richmond, had returned to live in Charlottesville, and had moved to D.C.when he was almost 50, and then had moved to Pittsburgh no more than two years before he died.  He had worked as a cook, a grocer, a painter, and a watchman.  His son, Alonzo, and grandson, Carl Curtis Reed, took up the last trade in which he had worked and carried on in the plastering business.",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5141/5637302609_9b0878517e.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s12,story,,,Sophia Walker,"Sophia  Woodfolk (Walker) <br> 1835 - 1880+ <br><br> The marriage registers of Sophia’s children reveal that she was a Woodfolk, one of Lucy’s many children. In 1856, the Rogers family ""gave"" Sophia to their son Dr. William G. Rogers, according to the fiduciary accounts settling Rogers’ estate. James B. Rogers accepted $400 towards Sophia’s $900 ""value,""  and the remaining $500 became part of the advancement noted in the fiduciary account after his death. Most of the gifts of slaves to his children involved children, and Sophia's advancement is unusual. Although no age is given in the Fiduciary records as to how old she was at the time of advancement, she was probably an adult of around 21. The year of the advancement coincides with the time that Rogers was moving from his home near Longwood to the newly completed Bleak House. Sophia may have wanted to stay near the original home and may have managed to get her owner to agree to the transfer. Her husband may have been enslaved on adjoining Michie property.<br><br>In 1858, two years after she was advanced, her new owner, W. G. Rogers, reported that ""Sophy"" had given birth to a  female child.<br><br>After Emancipation, the Personal Property Taxes show George Walker was living on the property of B. F. Davis in 1867 and 1868. The Davis family, E.M. Davis, R.O. Davis and B F. Davis, lived at the intersection of Bleak House Road and Buck Mountain Road across from the location of Old Michie Tavern. Patsy Michie Davis, Robert's first wife, was one of Beau Jim Michie's daughters and had grown up at Longwood, the property adjoining the Rogers’ original home on Buck Mountain Road, where W.G. Rogers lived at the time of his father’s death. Mariah Evans, one of the Bleak House enslaved, lived with a former slave of Beau Jim Michie's, Perkins Evans, after Emancipation. Beau Jim Michie's grandson, Patrick Michie Davis was the overseer at Bleak House and probably lived there, renting the house after Rogers' death. There were clearly ongoing relationships between the Rogers and Michie families and between their enslaved people.<br><br>George Walker,35, who appears on the 1870 census, is likely the same as George, 12, listed in the 1847 Inventory of the estate of James ""Beau Jim"" Michie of Longwood. There is another entry in the Michie inventory for Cornelia Walker, 9. This is the only surname listed for any slave of Michie's. The name after Cornelia's in the inventory list is Scott. Later, George Walker named one of his children Scott, which could suggest that George, Cornelia and Scott were Walker siblings among the Michie slaves.<br><br>After Michie's death, those enslaved at Longwood were divided among the many Michie children. George went to Joseph P. Michie. Scott went to Eugene Michie, and Cornelia Walker to Claudius Michie. The original division seems to have shifted often as Michie's children died and the enslaved were rented between family members.<br><br>In the 1870 census, living with R.O.Davis, 35, (White), was George Walker, 35, and his family. His wife, Sophy, was also 35, and they had three sons, Charles, 16, and William, 14, and Robert, 10. His two daughters were Alice, 12, and Eliza, 4. Alice's birth date coincides with the birth reported by W. G. Rogers in 1858. Alice also appears on the Bleak House inventory as a child of 5.<br><br>In 1866, George Walker reported that his wife"" Sofa"" had given birth to a son, Scott. Scott does not show up on the 1870 census, but does on the 1880 census, as a 13 year old, living with his parents, George Walker, 44, a laborer on a farm, Sophia, 47, and siblings Eliza A., 10, and Robert L., 7. This is either an incorrect age for Robert L. who is on the 1870 census, or another child with the same name. In the 1880 census, the family had moved and lived near J. L. Garth, who had a stepdaughter, Fannie Michie, living with them. <br><br>Sophia and George Walker probably died sometime before the 1900 census.  Four of their children emigrated to Muchakinock, Iowa, following in the steps of their mother’s brother, their uncle, Nelson Woodfolk.<br><br> In 1882,  Sophia’s son, Charles Walker, already a miner in Iowa, married Lydia Gilette, 18, daughter of Moses and Jane Gilette in Albemarle County. ((Lydia Gilette’s brother, Caesar, married one of Nelson Woodfolk’s daughters in Iowa, see: Nelson Woodfolk). Charles Walker stated that his father’s name was"" Merryman"", and his own middle name was ""Mermon"", a name he passed down.  Their  son, Leonard Lewis Walker, was born July 7, 1883, and a daughter, Eva C. was born in 1888. Lydia died of consumption in 1896, when Leonard was 13. He may have moved in with his aunt Alice Walker Carey and her family in Iowa after Lydia’s death. Eva went to live with her father’s cousin, Connie Reed Carr, who lived in Muscatine, Iowa, a town near Muchakinock, with her husband Nelson Carr who was also from Albemarle County, VA. In 1910,  Eva married Andrew  J. Brookins, locally famous for inventing an automatic train control.  They lived a long life together, had several children and died in Illinois in the mid 1950’s.  <br><br> In 1884, Alice Walker, or Mary A., as she was sometimes known, married Wilson Carey, son of Wilson and Harriet Ferguson Carey, who was from Scottsville, Virginia. Theirs was the first of the marriages of the Walker children that actually took place in Muchakinock.<br><br>  Robert, b. 1871, married Mary Rhodes, in Muchakinock in 1894.  The Walkers’ daughter, Eliza Ann, born shortly after Emancipation, married John Blakey in Iowa in 1898. John Blakey, son of Louis and Frances Goins Blakey, had been raised in Union Ridge, Albemarle Co.  A cyclone in Buxton in 1903, injured Eliza and killed their three year old daughter, Georgina, nicknamed, Georgie.  In the house next door, a neighbor’s 6 year old was also killed.  John Blakey died in 1928 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Eliza died there in 1945.  She was survived by 3 grandchildren and a daughter, Mrs. George E.

Lewis also served as the guardian for his nephew, Meriwether Lewis.<br><br>In 1779, Mildred Lewis married David Wood. She brought slaves with her, one of whom would have been Hannah's mother and perhaps a very young Hannah. When David Wood died in 1818, Hannah was listed as one of the dower slaves, meaning a slave who had been brought to the marriage by the wife. This story was also one carried in Hannah’s own descendants’ oral history.<br><br>In David Wood's will of 1818, Hannah was 28 and had a baby named Mariah. Evans’ family oral history says that Mariah had been fathered by David Wood.  Mildred and David Wood were married in 1779, so Hannah was born after their marriage if this is a correct date for Hannah's birth. The family oral history also says her mother was a Native American. Nicholas Lewis, Mildred's father, had fought in the Cherokee wars. In 1776, Lewis served in an expedition against the Cherokee Indians. Hannah's mother may have been captured and enslaved during these wars. <br><br>Hannah was a cook for the Rogers family. The separate brick kitchen building for Bleak House still stands and an outline of cooking grease and smoke is visible on the outside of the building on the wall where the open hearth fireplace is situated.<br><br>In the inventory of 1863, Hannah appears in the line, ""deduct for keeping servant woman aged 85 years Hanna $300."" This estimate of her age projects a birth date of 1778, 12 years earlier than the one given in the 1818 will of David Wood, which would have been 1790. <br><br>After Emancipation, Hannah lived with her daughter Mariah and Mariah's husband, Perkins Evans. She died in 1877 and Perkins Evans reported her death.<br><br>She is probably buried in the Evans family graveyard in Earlysville, her marker one of the simple field stones near the center. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/HannaWoodsGrave.jpg) (Hannah Wood's grave is probably marked by a simple field stone in the center of the Evans' family cemetery in Earlysville)",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5622921104_d79ebfefb7.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s14,story,,,Ella Wood,"Ella/Priscilla/Sillar/Siller/Cillah Wood( Brown)<br>c.1788-c.1864<br><br>Ella was one of the two slaves, the other being Hannah Wood, on the Bleak House inventory of 1863 to receive a negative value because of her age. She was valued at costing her owner $100 to maintain. Ella was estimated at being 75 years old. However, she and Hannah Wood may have been the same age, 73, because in the will of David Wood in 1818, she was listed as 28, as was Hannah. They may have been sisters, and both used Wood as their surname.<br><br>In 1793, Nicholas Lewis sold nine slaves to David Wood, among them ""Jack and Siller his wife."" Five of the slaves sold were children, Jenny, Charles, Nancy, Grace and Wallace.  In 1804, David Wood gave Cillah and Jenny, her child, to his daughter Anna. If the ""Siller"" sold in 1793 was the same woman that was listed as one of Mildred Wood's dower slaves in 1818, she had been born earlier than 1790, at least 15 years earlier. In 1818, when David Wood died, ""Siller"" and baby Frances were noted as being dower slaves of Mildred Lewis Wood, as was Jenny, 9. Since Anna Wood does not appear in her father's will, it is probable that she had died and her slaves had reverted to the family.<br><br>After Mildred Wood's death, both Hannah and Priscilla went to live with Mildred’s daughter, Margaret Rogers, wife of James B. Rogers. Priscilla was the mother of Adam Whipps and her name was noted on his death certificate in 1921, as was the name of his father, James Brown, the ""Jack"" who had been sold along with ""Siller"" by Nicholas Lewis. This indicates a strong oral history in the family and an intent to keep names and memory alive.<br><br>Siller was a member of the Chestnut Grove Baptist Church. In 1858, according to the records of the church, ""James B. Rogers' Sillar"" was baptised. On ""Sunday 22 June Elder B. Creel preached from Hebrews 3. Ch 1...Baptised on Sunday morning, Colored persons at Frays Mill, James B. Rogers' Cillar."" The bible quotation spoken at the baptism includes words perhaps encouraging Priscilla to accept her enslaved condition, ""And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant."" Cilla was the only one of James B. Rogers' slaves who became a member of this church, although her widowed son, Adam, was later married by Zachariah Wood who was minister there. James B. Rogers was a member of the Buck Mountain Episcopal Church, not the baptist church that Cilla chose for her own.<br><br>Adam's father James Brown is not on the list of David Wood's slaves on his 1818 will. <br><br>Priscilla Wood Brown does not appear on the 1870 census, so she must have died between 1863-1870.",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5625024579_152b48a43c.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s15,story,,,Mariah Evans,"Mariah Wood ( Evans)<br>c.1816-1902 <br><br>Mariah Wood Evans was Hannah Wood's daughter and, according to Evans family oral history, the ""companion"" of her owner, James B. Rogers and mother of several of his children. Family tradition says that Mariah's father was David Wood, the husband of Mildred Lewis who had brought Hannah, Mariah's mother, as a dower slave to her marriage. Because Hannah is believed by the family to have been Native American, or part Native American, it is possible that Mariah was not African American. She is   consistently listed as ""mulatto.""<br><br>The early part of Mariah's life was spent with David and Mildred Wood on their farm, Landsdale, northwest of Charlottesville. When David Wood died in 1818, Mariah and her mother stayed with Mildred because of their status as dower slaves. From the slave census, it seems that they joined the Rogers family slaves sometime before Mildred's death in 1838, because slaves of comparable ages appear on the 1840 census for the Rogers slave holdings. There was no list of slaves at Mildred's death, so it is likely that they were given to the Rogers before she died.<br><br>Mariah would have been around 22 when she and Hannah joined the other enslaved at the Rogers plantation near Longwood on Buck Mountain Road in the area outside Earlysville. Her first child, Angelina was born around 1837, when she was about 21. Angelina may have been fathered by Perkins Evans with whom Mariah lived after emancipation. The Evans family oral history tells that she may have had children by another man before she began to bear James B. Rogers' children. In 1841, she had a son, Robert. Both Robert and Angelina were not part of the Evans’ oral history, so they may have both been children from an earlier relationship. <br><br>Mariah bore a daughter, Fanny, in 1843, when she was around 27. This is the first of her at least six children by James B. Rogers, according to the family recounting. In 1845, Thornton was born, in 1848, Mary, in 1850, Link/Nathaniel, Calvin in 1852, and William Bernard, her last child, in 1854.<br><br>James B. Rogers' wife, Margaret Wood, had her first child at about 29 and her last when she was 40. It appears that Mariah followed a similar pattern, having her last child at around 38. The last child born to Margaret Rogers was Ellen, in 1840 and three years later, Fanny was born to Mariah.<br><br>At James B. Rogers’ death in 1863, Mariah was valued at $1000. She was 47 years old.<br><br>Seven years later, in the 1870 census Mariah was living with Perkins ""Ivins"" (Evans) and in another separate census entry with Perkins ""Jennins."" In one entry, Perkins was listed as a farmer and in the other as a blacksmith. Perkins had been enslaved by Beau Jim Michie of Longwood, on Buck Mountain Road, Earlysville.  Longwood and the earlier Rogers’ plantation shared a common property line. After Michie's death, Perkins moved between the children of his former owner, probably as his skills as a blacksmith were needed by them. In the appraisal of Michie's estate, 1847, Perkins was identified as a  blacksmith, and it is certainly from him that Mariah's son, Link Evans, learned this valuable trade. In the Personal Property Tax of 1870, Perkins had 2 cattle worth $30 and 3 hogs worth $6, more wealth than many newly freed men who owned nothing. The two census entries on the same census may reflect this family was living still on Bleak House land and farming it, as well as living in Earlysville where Perkins labored as a blacksmith. In both locations, they were living near former Bleak House slaves. At the farm they were near Adam Whips, Arthur Jefferson and Thornton Ivins (Evans), and in Earlysville, they again lived next to Arthur Jefferson. In both locations, Mariah's mother, Hannah, was living with them.<br><br>In the 1880 census, Mariah and Perkins Evans were living in Earlysville next to Nathaniel ""Link"" Evans. Mary Evans Ray, abandoned by her husband, was also living with them as was Mary's daughter, Jennie Ray. Perkins worked as a blacksmith and Nathaniel was his apprentice.<br><br>Perkins Evans died in 1888 and his death was reported by Link Evans. He had been born around 1808 but his parents were unknown or at least not revealed. The descendant Evans family had no knowledge or stories about him, indeed, the assumption by the family was that he had been a displaced freedman who had found a home with Mariah. However, given the proximity of the places Mariah and Perkins had been enslaved, it is clear that they had a long relationship, and perhaps had had children together. Perkins Evans may or may not have been related to Cloe Evans, a Free Person of Color, who lived at Longwood with Beau Jim Michie and worked as a ""housekeeper.""  If Perkins was fathered by an unknown relative of hers and an enslaved woman, he would not have shared in the Cloe Evans family’s free status since slavery passed through the mother’s line.<br><br>After Perkins' death, Mariah moved in with her son Thornton and his wife Marinda Brown Evans. They lived in Earlysville near Link Evans. In the 1900 census Mariah said she had had 9 children and 7 were still living. Fannie and one other child for whom there is no record had died.<br><br>In 1902, Mariah died. Her daughter-in-law, Marinda, Thornton's wife, wrote to her sister-in-law, Ada Evans, who lived in West Virginia with her husband Calvin.A copy of the letter was shared by Jim Evans, one of Mariah’s descendants through Calvin’s line. <br><br>"" Earlysville, Va.<br><br>May 9, 1902<br><br>My dear sister,<br><br> This morning find me busy engaged in the pleasure of writing to all of the family and send them a lock of Muh's (Mariah's) hair. She quietly left us Monday evening at 5 minutes after 6. I miss her very much, her vacancy as well as the care of her. I suppose Calvin will tell you all the particulars of the funeral but for fear he will forget where it was found in the 90th Psalms and 12th verse all joins me in love to you and family and also Annie and her family. All of us are tolerably well and I hope this may find you all in perfect health.<br><br>Your loving sister<br><br>Marinda Evans""<br><br>Mariah is buried, most likely, in the Evans family cemetery in Earlysville, where Link Evans once had his home and blacksmith shop. In the center of the small cemetery are at least three graves marked by simple fieldstones. These are probably the graves of Mariah's mother, Hannah, Mariah's husband, Perkins, and her own.<br><br>Mariah’s photograph, from the original and now lost original tintype, is widely reproduced and treasured among the Evans family.  One of the reproductions of her image hangs in Bleak House, a gift from one of her descendants.<br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/MariahEvans.jpg) (Mariah Evans from a lost tintype, courtesy of James Evans)",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5625639414_c0d85f58b7.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rogers Estate identified as 43 years old and valued at $2000. <br><br>After emancipation, Allen Reed went to live on the land of Warner Wood where he appeared on the 1867, 1868 and 1869 Personal Property Tax list.<br><br>In the 1870 census, Allen Reed was working as a gardener and living next to Mary Ann Harper and her son Warner Wood. The house the Reeds lived in may still exist in Farmington, located near the main house, once a slave cabin and now a gardening shed.<br><br> Mary Ann Harper was the widow of Robert Wood and sister-in-law of Margaret Wood and James B. Rogers. Rogers had become his nephew Warner Wood’s guardian when Mary Ann married Joseph Harper after the death of Robert Wood. Mary Ann and Joseph Harper moved to Missouri in 1832. Rogers had encouraged Warner to file suit in court to prevent his mother from taking the family slaves with her when she moved west. When Joseph Harper died in 1848, Mary Ann Harper moved back to Albemarle County. Soon she became a very wealthy woman when her brother died. Both Mary Ann and her brother were English and the estate her brother left her was not affected by the chaos that ensued after confederate money lost its value. Mary Ann Harper became one of the four wealthiest people in Albemarle County. By the 1870 census, Mary Ann and her daughter, Lucilla, were living at Farmington, a house Mary Ann had purchased for her widowed, childless brother, hoping he would live near her, although he died before he could move in. Mary Ann’s son, Warner, who had made his peace with his mother after some difficult years, sold his father’s Landsdale farm and moved into Farmington with his mother and sister.<br><br>Allen Reed may have gardened for them at their Farmington estate. He would have known Warner Wood, the Rogers' nephew, because there continued to be interaction between Rogers and Warner when Warner ran his father’s farm, Landsdale.  Allen Reed’s wife, Judy, a seamstress, may have sewn for Mary Ann Harper and her daughter. James B. Rogers had also supervised the rental of the Wood family’s enslaved, prevented by the suit from going to Missouri with the Harpers, during Mary Ann’s absence. <br><br>Allen and Judy Reed and all their family are described as mulatto on both the 1870 and 1880 censuses. <br><br> In 1880 Allen was still working as a gardener, but he no longer lived next to Farmington. He and Judy were living in Charlottesville and were with their 8 year old grandson, Junius, who had been born in New York. In the previous census, they appeared to be caring for Alice Brown, a baby, who lived next door. Junius and Alice were their daughter Connie’s children. <br><br>In June of 1881, there is a death index entry for Allen Reed, (age 85), who died of ""fever.""

s17,story,,,Robert Evans,"Robert Evans<br> 1841 - 1918<br><br>Robert Evans was the second of Mariah's children, and like Angelina, a family member whose memory was lost in Evans family's oral history as it was passed into the 21st century. <br><br>Robert was listed on the inventory of 1863 as being 22 years old and valued at $3000, one of the three most valuable slaves Rogers had owned. After Emancipation, he went to live in Free Union and appears on the Personal Property Tax records living on the land of William Ferguson, Rogers' step-grandfather. Here Robert married Martha Harris who gave birth in 1866 to a daughter, Mary. The birth was reported by William Fergeson, who noted the father as Robert Evans and said he was a farmer. I have not been able to find Robert, Martha or Mary Evans in the 1870 census, but in 1875, the death of Martha Evans, 35, on June 14, was reported by her husband (page 5, line 47, 1875, Albemarle County Death Records.) The cause of death was dropsy which would be identified now as edema, perhaps from congestive heart failure. In 1869, Robert's brother Thornton and his wife Marinda had a daughter whom they named Martha, perhaps after Robert's wife. Marinda's sister, Lizzie Brown, who was living with her in the 1870 census, may be Robert's second wife. In the 1910 census she identified herself as Lizzie B., which may stand for her maiden name Brown. Thornton and Marinda also named a son, born in 1875, after Robert. <br><br>In 1880, Robert had married again and appeared on the census with his new wife Lizzie and a 4 year old son, Willie. Robert is described as mulatto in the three censuses in which he appears. He was living in the Rivanna district with neighbors which indicate he was near Earlysville. He worked as a farmer. Neither he nor his wife Lizzie was literate.<br><br>In 1886, Mary Evans, identifying herself as the  daughter of Robert and his first wife Martha, was married to Lewis Givens. Mary, also called Mary Etta, and Lewis Givens adopted a child, Lillie, 8, and the family is in the 1920 census. Mary Etta Evans Givens died in 1930 in Stony Point.<br><br>Robert had moved back to Free Union by the 1900 census. He was living next door to his son William who had recently married. Robert was now the grandfather of little Robert, his namesake, who had been born to William and Loula Evans within the past year. Both Robert and William were farming and lived in a neighborhood of farm families. Lizzie Evans reported she had had only one child during her life and that she had been married 20 years.<br><br>Again the family relocated, this time to the city of Charlottesville by the 1910 census. This move was probably driven by their son William who had found work in an ice factory. Robert still was farming and his grandson Robert, 12, unlike his grandfather, had learned to read and write and was attending school.<br><br>The last move that Robert Evans made was to Richmond where his son and grandson had gone, in 1917. On October 30,  1918, Robert died in the Richmond Hospital after prostate surgery. His age was estimated as 59, but he was closer to 77. The family was living at this time at 312 E. Preston Ave. in Richmond. His grandson and namesake reported his death and noted his profession as ""laborer."" The father of the deceased was given as ""Park Evans"" (Perkins Evans) but Robert Evans’ grandson did not know the name of Perkins Evans’ wife, his great-grandmother, Mariah Evans. <br><br>Robert Evans' body was taken to Earlysville and buried in the Evans family cemetery on November 2, 1918. His tombstone is a thick slab of stone, with notched decoration. It is about 12 inches in height and made from a broken piece of marble. There is no birth date inscribed, only the October 30, 1918 death date.<br><br> Young Robert Evans, his grandson, registered for the World War 1 draft on Sept. 12, 1918, a little more than a month before his grandfather died. He identified his next of kin as William Evans, his father, who lived on 3rd St. in Richmond. William must have died shortly after this, because he does not appear on the 1920 census, and Lizzie, Robert Evans widow, was living with her grandson and his wife, Gertrude, in Richmond in 1920. Robert Jr. was working as a laborer doing ""street work.""<br><br>I can find no thread of this family beyond this census.<br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/RobtEvans.jpg)(Robert Evans tombstone is made from a piece of broken marble.

s18,story,,,Kitty Whipps,"Kitty Whipps 1848-1934 <br><br>  Kitty was the first of eleven children born to Cynthia Woodfolk and Adam Whipps.  Cynthia was the daughter of Lucy Woodfolk and Adam Whipps was the son of Pricilla Wood.  Both Lucy and Pricilla were enslaved by the Rogers, so the couple would have most likely grown up together on the same plantation.  <br><br>Kitty was only with her parents until she was eight, when she was ""given"" to Rogers’ daughter Martha and her husband Dr. Alfred Cole Woods, who lived at Woodburn, which is now the location of Forest Lakes North and Hollymead Town Center ( Erik Irtenkauf, Hiding in Plain Sight, https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=71b34fc27ef943068268d913304f8c2f).  She joined three other children that Rogers had sent to live and work there. Seven years later, her sister Fanny joined her at Woodburn.<br><br>After Emancipation, Kitty married Perkins Ray (b.1845) during the traditional lull in the work year, on December 29, 1869.  She was already the mother of one child at this time, Joseph Luther, born c.1866, and the father was not Perkins Ray.<br><br> Perkins Ray had grown up on a plantation near the Rogers’ homes and had known those enslaved there all his life. After their marriage, he and Kitty lived near their old neighbors and  he worked as a farm laborer, but by 1880, the family had moved to Charlottesville and Perkins was a railroad hand and Kitty was a servant.  The census taker noted that Kitty was ""sick"", although she lived many more years.  With them was Joseph, 14, working also as a servant, and four other children. <br><br> Perkins Ray died before the 1910 census, and Kitty said that she had had nine children, seven surviving.  She was 72, not working, and lived with her two daughters. Fannie, probably the last child, was born in 1888 when Kitty was 50. She had been named after the sister who had joined her at Woodburn. Fannie worked as a washerwoman and her other daughter, Lula Reeves, was a cook.<br><br> Joseph Ray, 1867-1939, Kitty’s first child, achieved startling prominence, seeming to leave the world of his mother and sisters far behind.  He married four times, first in 1891, in Charlottesville to Sallie Sellars. The couple moved to Pittsburgh, PA where their daughter, Ray’s only child, Imogene Ray Robinson (1892-1961) was born, but by 1912, he had divorced Sellars and married Lucille O. Harris. <br><br>Joseph had started out by working as a steward for Mrs.Thomas Carnegie. Her"" trust"" in him had grown, according to his obituary, (Morning Call, Allentown PA, Monday, August 21, 1939), until he ""supervised her huge island estate off the Florida coast.  Then he joined the Carnegie Steel Co. where he met Mr. (Charles M.) Schwab…(and) came to Bethlehem in 1906….""  The obituary describes Joseph Ray as a ""traveling companion to… Schwab.."", one who had """"intimately watched the rise (of Schwab) … from a grocery boy to the leading steel magnate of the United States.""  Schwab had brought Ray to Bethlehem to ""organize the restaurant at the steel company.""  Ray had managed it until his retirement and had been ""in complete charge of Mr. Schwab’s private railroad cars, the Loretto’s.""<br><br>In 1919, while Ray was married to his second wife, Lucille, Charles Schwab applied for a passport on behalf of Joseph Ray, explaining that Mr. Ray had not been feeling well and was planning to visit Cuba for a respite. Ray did not stay in that second marriage much longer.  In July 1923, Ray, by then described as ""food concessionaire, right hand man"" of Charles Schwab and one of the ""wealthiest of his race"" married Lena Douglas Holt, a socialite, singer, composer and music critic associated with the  Harlem Renaissance.  Their divorce, less than two years later, was the subject of lurid celebrity-style newspaper coverage. <br><br>In 1931, Joseph Ray married for the fourth time.  He married a White woman, Mary Zboysky, who was more than 25 years younger than himself. The wedding application contained information that Joseph may have been revealing for the first time publicly, his White father’s name, Luther Dunn. His mother, he wrote, was Catherine Whipps, and her married name was Ray. ( This is the only time Kitty seems to have been called ""Catherine."") At this time, Joseph also stated that he was White, although his death certificate eight years later identified him as ""negro.""<br><br> Luther Dunn is a largely unknown figure.  He was living in 1870 with E. O. Michie and both were described as ""merchant""(s), although Michie, only 28 at the time,  was ""retired.""  Dunn was born in 1846, two years before Kitty Whipps. Mary Evans Ray, Perkins Ray’s sister-in-law, formerly enslaved at Bleak House, was working as a housekeeper for these two men. Her small daughter Jennie was with her.  It is impossible to know when the relationship between Kitty Whipps and Luther Dunn started or how they met, but Joseph carried his name ""Luther"" and revealed his identity sixty years later. <br><br> Ray’s daughter, Imogene, although she did not pre-decease him, was not mentioned in his obituary, although she was married and mother to Ray’s only grandchild, Jeanetta, born in 1910. <br><br> In 1930, Kitty was still living with her daughter Fannie, who had married John Gildersleeve Tonsler (1895-1964).  John was the son of educator Benjamin Tonsler, a friend of Booker T. Washington’s and the principal of the Jefferson School in Charlottesville. John Tonsler’s mother, Fannie Gildersleeve, was the daughter of an enslaved woman and Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, a White professor at the University of Virginia. <br><br> John Gildersleeve Tonsler worked as a waiter, first in Charlottesville and later for the railroad in its dining cars.  Fannie and John Tonsler had at least five children, Lucile, and Gibsen, b. 1916,  Ben, b.1920, Laurence, 1921-2004 and Ray, who was born and died in 1924. <br><br> Kitty Whipps Ray died in 1934 and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery.",http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2060/5728190900_f5af706991.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s19,story,,,Thornton Evans,"Thornton Evans<br> 1845 - 1907<br><br>Thornton was the fourth of Mariah's children. He appears on the Inventory of the Bleak House estate as an 18 year old valued at $2700. He would have been at the prime of his working life, although he was not valued as highly as his brother Robert who was two years older. Thornton may have been the second of the children Mariah bore to her owner, James B. Rogers, and he was born the same year, 1845, as Rogers' first grandchild, Charles Hunter Wood. Thornton is the first of Mariah's first three children to have been remembered in the Evans family oral history.<br><br>After Emancipation, Thornton went to live and work at Longwood, the farm next to the first home the Rogers family had lived in. He appeared on the Personal Property Tax lists in 1867 and 1868 working for Theodore Michie who lived at Longwood after the death of his father, Beau Jim Michie. In 1869, Thornton worked for John P. Michie who lived at Chestnut Avenue, a property that lay next to Bleak House off a common road, once called Avenue Road, now Bleak House Road. Chestnut Avenue was the plantation on which Thorton’s wife, Marinda Brown, had been enslaved along with her grandparents, Thomas and Rhoda, where they appeared in the 1857 will of John E. Michie (Will Book 25, p.284, Albemarle County Courthouse). In Michie's will, the name appears as ""Meranda."" On 19th of July, 1868, Thornton and Marinda married. Marinda's name is noted as ""Rindy."" Her age was given as 21 and Thorntons as 22, although he may have been older. Marinda gave her parents’ names as Major and Hannah. She had probably been raised by her grandparents, at least since John E. Michie's death, because her own parents do not appear on his inventory of slaves or in a census thereafter.<br><br>The year of his marriage, Thornton acquired 6 acres of land from Theodore A. Michie, although the land was not registered by deed until later. The Evans family lore suggests that this land was in part a wedding gift, or that he was helped with the purchase by a Rogers or Michie family member. The land was taken off the Longwood estate land. In 1870, Thornton paid tax on his horse which was worth $40. Mariah's husband, Perkins Evans, had 2 cows and 2 hogs on which he paid taxes that year, but no horse.<br><br>In the 1870 census, Thornton was living with Marinda and her grandparents, Thomas and Rhoda Brown. The Browns and the young Evans family lived close to the people they had grown up with, Adam Whipps and his family, Arthur Jefferson, and Thornton's mother, Mariah, who was living with Perkins Evans. Thornton and his family were probably living on Chestnut Avenue land, near Bleak House. They were the parents of one child, a daughter Martha, who was usually called by her nickname, ""Mattie."" <br><br>By 1880, Thornton had moved to his own land near Longwood. He was farming and was relatively prosperous as is indicated by his inclusion in the city and county directories which featured only prominent people of color. His brother Nathaniel, or Link, was also in the directories. The agricultural census revealed he owned 6 acres, 4 were in grass and 2 in woods. The land, fences and buildings of his farm were worth $50, his implements and machinery, $50, his livestock, $100 , and he had spent $20 on fertilizers. Two people worked the farm.<br><br>Rhoda Brown, the grandmother who had raised his wife, died in 1889. She had lived with Thornton and Marinda since they were married and Thornton reported her death (Albemarle Co. Death index, p. 4, line 7.) The same year Thornton reported the death of his ""grandson"", Jack Fry, (Albemarle Co. Death Index, p. 5, line 39. ) Jack was his son-in-law, married to his daughter Mattie, and not his grandson.<br><br>Thornton could not read or write, according to the 1900 census, but his wife Marinda could. It was she who wrote a letter to her sister-in-law, Ada Evans, wife of Calvin, when the brothers’ mother Mariah died in 1902. Mariah had been living with Marinda and Thornton. <br><br>"" Earlysville, Va.<br> May 9, 1902<br>My dear sister,<br><br> This morning find me busy engaged in the pleasure of writing to all of the family and send them a lock of Muh's (Mariah's) hair. She quietly left us Monday evening at 5 minutes after 6. I miss her very much, her vacancy as well as the care of her. I suppose Calvin will tell you all the particulars of the funeral but for fear he will forget where it was found in the 90th Psalms and 12th verse all joins me in love to you and family and also Annie and her family. All of us are tolerably well and I hope this may find you all in perfect health. Your<br> loving sister<br> Marinda Evans"" (letter shared by James Evans, descendant of Calvin Evans)<br><br>Less than five years later, in 1907, Thornton died. George Crickenberger, a White farmer who lived at Bleak House and farmed it after the Civil War, wrote in his day book, ""T. Evans paralysed the first day of February and died Feb. 5, Monday, buried Feb. 7. Earlysville."" He was buried in the small family graveyard across from Link Evans home in Earlysville. His headstone is substantial, reflecting the family's prosperity at the time of his death. He and Marinda had been married almost 40 years.<br><br>In the 1900 census, Marinda told the census taker that she had had four children and three were still alive. Her children were Martha (Mattie), born in 1869, Mary (Ann) born 1870, Sallie, born 1872, and Robert, born 1875.<br><br>Mattie married twice. By her first husband, Jack Frye, she had one daughter, Mamie, born in 1889. Mamie died in Queens, NY, in 1965. In some records, Mamie went by the name Jefferson, probably because her father, Jack Frye, had died the year she was born. Mattie remarried James Jefferson and had three children, Willie, 1895-1961, Emmett, 1896-1975, and Florence, 1907-1988. Willie died in Laken, W. VA. Emmett Jefferson married Clara Seay and they had James, 1922-1991, Willie, Carl, Frances Hazel, and Emma,1929-1984 who lived in Washington, DC, and married a Porter. Emma Porter had Reginald, Stephen, Michael and Patricia Porter. Florence died in Clinton, MD. She had married James Othor Wright, 1904-1955, and they had a daughter, Mary Jordan.<br><br>Mattie's children are buried in Lincoln Cemetery in Charlottesville.<br><br>Marinda's second child, Mary Ann, married John Grigsby. She died in 1944 and is buried in the Evans family cemetery, as are other members of her family. Mary Ann’s son, Robert Evans Grigsby,  was born in 1897. He married Viola Givens, 1894-1977, and they had one son, Adolph Grigsby, who lived in Alexandria, VA. Robert Evans Grigsby went by the name Evans, and he is buried in the Evans family cemetery, as is his sister, Alfonza,1900-1916. <br><br>In 1910, the widowed, Marinda was noted by the census taker as being the head of her household. She was living with her daughter Mary (Ann) and son-in-law John Grigsby, who was farming, and the Grigsby's two children, son Evans, and daughter Alfonza. Also in this household was the Grigsby's niece, Mame Fry, Marinda's 20 year old granddaughter. She was a public school teacher.<br><br>Marinda Evans continued to live with the Grigsby family, John, Mary and grandson Evans, in 1920. They were running the family farm and still with them was Mamie Fry, now joined by a daughter, Thelma Herdon, 5. Mamie was no longer employed as a school teacher and describes herself as widowed, but in the next census, 1930, she stated she was divorced.<br><br>In 1930, John Grigsby, 61, was living by himself in Albemarle County. Mamie Fry had moved to Washington DC and brought her grandmother Marinda, then 80, with her. Two lodgers shared the rented home helping them make ends meet. Mamie worked as a waitress in a cafe.  Her daughter, Thelma, 16 was with them, as was Mamie's cousin, the Grigsby son, Evans Grigsby, 31, who was working as a laborer doing street construction. Evans’ wife, Viola, had stayed in Earlysville with her two small boys, Norburt, 4, and Adolph, 2. Viola was living with her parents, near to Mattie Evans Jefferson, her husband's aunt.<br><br>Marinda Evans died in 1935. She would have been 90 years old and had been widowed 28 years.  There is a depression in the ground next to Thornton Evans grave where she may be buried in the Evans family cemetery.<br><br> Thornton and Marinda have living descendants in the Charlottesville area through their daughter Martha/Mattie’s Jefferson line. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/ThorntonEvanshouse.jpg) (Thornton Evans' home in Earlysville, VA)",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5070/5727269683_2ce4e44ce8.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s20,story,,,Harry Haston,"Harry/ Henry Houston/Hughsen/Haston  1847-1912 <br><br>When James B. Rogers died in 1863, one of the enslaved teenagers at Bleak House was a young man named Harry.  He was 16, making him born in 1847, and he was one of the two most highly monetarily valued among the enslaved community.  He and Robert (Evans), who was 20, were each valued at $3000, an indication of their strength, health and intelligence.  He had been enslaved by the Rogers since his birth, a child his age appearing first as a 3 year old in 1850 and then as a 12 year old on the 1860 slave schedule section of the census.  It would be unusual for a slave owner to acquire a young child below the age of 8 who would have been unable to work, so it is likely that his mother was one of the women enslaved by the Rogers family.  Henry’s marriage record states that his mother was named ""Roda""; she may have been one of the unknown women in the 1850 slave schedule owned by the Rogers, and may have died before the period when deaths were supposed to be recorded.<br><br>The name Harry is a nickname for Henry and we might assume that he chose to leave his nickname behind after Emancipation.( Another possibility for Harry’s identity is Harry White, whose name is always Harry, but whose birthdate is not a good match.)<br><br>After Emancipation, Henry ""Houston"" was on the Personal Property Tax List of 1867 at Wayland’s Still House as was his future father-in-law, Peter Step.  There is such a distillery on the Peyton Map of 1875, but it is in the southeast of the county, a considerable  distance from Bleak House. ( However, there was a Wayland family in the Earlysville area at this time, perhaps it was their still house.) In 1868 and 1869, Harry was at Michie’s Old Tavern which was originally on Buck Mountain Road, at the end of the road near Bleak House. In these two years, Peter Step was one year at Michie’s Old Tavern and the other on B. F. Davis’s land which adjoined the tavern.<br><br>In 1870, the census shows  Henry ""Haston"" was living next to Peter Step in a household that included other members of the Step family and his own children by Patsy Step, Peter’s daughter.  Patsy was living with her parents in one of the two adjacent houses in this fluid living arrangement.<br><br>In 1877, Harry ""Hughsen"" married Patsy Step, daughter of Peter and Betsy.  The location of the marriage was noted at the top of the bond and at the bottom.  One place is John P. Michie, who lived at Locust Grove, and the other at Michie Davis, who lived across the river from his uncle, John P. Michie, near Michie’s Old Tavern.  (Patrick) Michie Davis had worked as overseer for Rogers and had rented Bleak House after his death. He had managed the plantation operations that continued when the contents of Bleak House but not the enslaved people were sold in 1864.<br><br> Henry and Patsy were married in January, the slow time of the year for farm workers, by Rev. Tinsley Woodfolk, who had founded the Pleasant Grove Church in nearby Rivanna.  Calvin T. Munday swore an oath as to the age of the bride.  He was the 18 year old son of a White farmer in the neighborhood, and Mundy’s stand in for the family suggests that Peter Step was no longer alive.<br><br> The dates of their children’s births , Anna in 1865 and Mary in 1867, show that Henry and Patsy had been together since Emancipation.  Peter Step was a Free Person of Color and lived in the Old Michie Tavern neighborhood.  Henry and Patsy would have been neighbors since the Rogers had moved into Bleak House in 1854, if not before.<br><br> In 1888, Henry Houston joined Augustus Rives to buy property in the area he had lived in with the Step family.  The land was purchased from John P. and Sallie E. Michie from the Michie’s Old Tavern site.  Rives and Houston bought 7 acres and in 1911 Houston paid off the purchase price in full and had the deed recorded, signing with an X.  Rives had built on the property prior to their purchasing it, but Houston seems to have taken over ownership of the land. <br><br> By 1900, Betsy Step, then 80, was living with her daughter Patsy and son-in-law Henry, and Muscoe, 20, who may have been an adopted son.  Henry and Patsy had had 5 children and two were alive.  Betsy had birthed 15 children and 10 were still alive, although she lost all but two in the next 10 years.<br><br> By the 1910 census, the family moved to Stony Point to live with Henry and Patsy’s daughter, Mary, who had married Edward Fray.  All his life, Henry Houston had worked as a farm laborer and farmer, but in the 1910 census  he told the census taker he was a ""horse jockey."" He stated his age as 50, but he was actually 65.  Where was he practicing this new occupation? Many informal horse races were, no doubt, taking place at this time as well as at the more formal horse show days at local fairs that were put on by and for the African American residents of the county. <br><br> Henry Housten died in October, 1912.  His wife and her mother had died before him.  Luther Fray, who seems to have been a stepson of Henry’s daughter Mary Fray, reported his death and his burial at Stony Point. .<br><br> Henry Haston’s two daughters did not have surviving children.",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5213/5727849798_31d2596779.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s21,story,,,Hunter Murray,"Hunter Murray/Bibb  1849- 1870+ <br><br>  Hunter appears in the Fiduciary accounts that William Rogers compiled after the death of his father, Dr. James B. Rogers in 1863.  Hunter had been ""given"" to Rogers’ daughter Martha and her husband Dr. Alfred Cole in 1857 when he was about 8 years old, the standard age at which a child was assumed to be able to work productively. He may have been named after the Wood’s son, Charles Hunter Meriweather Woods, who was born in 1846, and always went by his middle name. <br><br> Hunter  appeared in the 1870 census, listed as a child of Edmund Murray in one of the two Murray census entries, (see Cornelia Bibb and Isetta and Mary Ann Bibb.) In  1870, Hunter was living with the Murray family near Farmington, where Edward Murray had been enslaved.  Hunter’s name appears after Edmund (52) and Lillie (78) Murray in the census listing.  He was working as a farm worker, as were Edmund Murray and his sons, Archer (13), and James E., (11.) Hunter and the other two brothers had gone to school the previous year, although all three were classified as unable to read or write. <br><br>The three young girls living with Edmund Murray and associated with Bleak House, Cornelia,15, Isaetta,11, and Mary Ann, 9,  had not gone to school.  They are listed separately, after Murray’s children. It is possible that Hunter was one of the Bibb children since they were together in this household <br><br> One of Murray’s sons, James Edward, was buried by J. F. Bell Funeral Home and his parents were listed as Edmund and Theodocia Harris Murray. Perhaps Hunter was Murray’s son, by either Rose or Peachy, women enslaved by the Rogers.<br><br> I have not been able to find Hunter Murray/Bibb after the 1870 census.",http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/5727872906_f68c26c577.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s22,story,,,Rebecca Reed,"Rebecca Reed  1845-1917 br><br> Rebecca was the daughter of Allen and Judy Woodfolk Reed.  When she was 7, Rebecca was ""given"" to Dr. W. G. Rogers, a physician like his father, James B. Rogers.  Rebecca was 16 when Emancipation came and she returned home to live with her parents and siblings, two of whom had also been sent away to live with Rogers’ children.  <br><br>The reunited 1870 Reed household showed 21 year old Rebecca working as a washerwoman.  She also appeared in a different 1870 entry with Lewis Rives, whom she had married in 1866, the day after Christmas. Lewis was a hotel waiter and lived in the University and Charlottesville area at this time.  While living downtown, Rebecca was ""keeping house"" and caring for their two year old son, Henry, named after her brother. <br><br> By 1880, Lewis and his son Henry were living in Washington, DC; he was working as a laborer and his son attending school.  Although Lewis Rives states he was married, Rebecca was not a part of the household that the census taker recorded. Lewis lived with her brother Henry in Washington in 1885. By 1891, Rebecca was in Washington, DC, living in the 1906 K. Street house where her brother, mother, sister, husband and son had once lived together.  She was described as ""widow of Louis"" in the 1891 city directory.  She worked several years there as a charwoman, domestic and maid.<br><br>  Rebecca Reeves’ will, submitted August 13, 1916, describes her as a ""widow and without children,""  her son, Henry, having predeceased her.  In her will, she left $25 dollars in cash to her sister, Mrs. Lizzie Smith, of Washington, DC, and $10 to her uncle, ""John Woodford, of Washington, DC.""  John Woodford was her mother’s brother, the man who had first left Albemarle County and welcomed so many in his family to a new life in Washington, DC. Rebecca left her jewelry to a friend, and her household effects and what was left of her property to her minister, Rev. Dr. John Milton Waldron and his wife.  She asked to be buried at the Harmony Cemetery in Washington, DC, her funeral expenses not to exceed $90.<br><br> This cemetery, also called Columbian Harmony Cemetery, was an African American cemetery begun as a burial society site before the Civil War.  However, in 1960, 37,000 graves were moved from here to National Harmony Memorial Park Cemetery in Landover, MD.(see Benjamin Whipps story)  Gravestones were abandoned and today the relocated graves are predominantly unmarked. The original site of the Harmony Cemetery is where the Rhode Island-Brentwood Metro Station lies.<br><br> Rebecca died ""suddenly, in Atlantic City, N.J."" on April 1, 1917.  Her remains were sent to John Woodford’s home for visitation before her burial service at Shiloh Baptist Church four days later.",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5727581245_4cded10039.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s23,story,,,Fannie E Evans,"Fannie Evans<br> 1843-1871+<br><br>""Fannie, 20, valued at $2800,"" appeared on the Inventory of the Estate of ""James B. Rogers, dec'd, "" in 1863.  She was the second of Mariah's daughters on the inventory.<br><br>We know very little about Fannie. She appeared on the census of 1870 living with Perkins, Mariah, Calhoun (Calvin,) Link, and Bernard (William Bernard) Jennins (Evans) and Hannah,90. This is one of the two entries in which the Evans family appears on this census, and this is the location at or near the Bleak House plantation where they had been enslaved. Perkins and the boys were farming. Fannie was the only member of the family working outside the home. She was a domestic servant, perhaps for James P. Michie who lived on adjacent property. She does not appear in the census in the other entry where the Evans family were living in Earlysville and Perkins was doing his blacksmith work.<br><br>In 1871, Harriet inherited property by the will of Harriet Evans. Harriet Evans' mother, Cloe Evans, had been the housekeeper at Longwood and she and Harriet lived on property which bordered that the Rogers family had lived on before they moved to Bleak House. Cloe and her family were Free Persons of Color during slavery. Harriet was a prosperous businesswoman and her will is unusual because it leaves valuable items, jewelry, clothes, furniture, cutlery, bed linens and bonds to both Black and White women, and only to women. <br><br>It is unclear whether there was any blood relationship between Cloe Evans and Perkins Evans. He was not her son. If he had been the son of a mother who was a Free Person of Color, he would not have been enslaved. However, if he were the son of an early, unknown son of Cloe's by a slave woman, he would have been born enslaved. <br><br>Although it is common for words to be spelled multiple ways in the 19th century, Harriet Evans' will distinguishes the spelling of Fannie Evins and Perkins Ivins. Perhaps this means to distinguish their relationship, perhaps it means nothing.<br><br>The will reads, ""Fannie Evins, daughter of Perkins Ivins, shall have one Trundle Bed, and its Bed Clothing, and four common knives and forks, and one Corner Cup-Board.""<br><br>Fannie and her mother Mariah were the only two members of the Evans family to inherit under this will.<br><br> I cannot find Fannie in any other census.",http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/5728176942_154024827f.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She joined Henry Reed who had been sent to the Wood family two years earlier when he was the same age.  <br><br> A.C. Wood reported the birth of her son, Oscar, in 1861 and her death in 1862, when she was 23.  The cause of her death was listed as  ""apoplexy,"" or what we would now call a stroke.   Oscar is recorded as a ""white"" birth, and therefore free,  which is most likely a mis-copying of the birth information, because Ellen, his mother, is categorized as enslaved. <br><br> After Emancipation, there was an Oscar Bruce on the 1870 census, born in 1862, living in the same household as Lucy and Armistead Woodfolk Sr. and their son Armistead who was working as a carpenter for the Wertenbaker family in Charlottesville.  Oscar is not a common name at this period; he is probably the same child.  This suggests that Ellen was likely another of Lucy and Armistead Woodfolk’s children.",http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3413/5728378112_f8cb3571bf.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s25,story,,,Mary Evans,"Mary Evans Ray<br> 1848 - 1880+<br><br>Mary, one of Mariah’s children, was the most valuable female slave in the 1863 Inventory of James B. Rogers. She was 16 years old and valued at $3000. Her sister, Angelina, was 26, ten years older, and was also valued at $3000, but her value included her small child, Ann Maria, who was a year old. Fannie, Mary's other sister was 20, but her inventory value was $2800, $200 less.<br><br>Two years after Emancipation, Mary, then 20, married Edward Ray. He was the son of Phillip and Harriet Ray and had been raised on a nearby plantation. The marriage took place at Perkins Evans’ house and the minister was Zachariah Wood, who was the White minister of Chestnut Grove Baptist Church, and lived near the Evans home and blacksmith shop. The marriage took place December 26, 1867.<br><br>After less than three years, Edward abandoned Mary and his small daughter, Jennie, who had been born the year after their marriage. He first moved into Charlottesville and then to Charleston, W. Va. where he took another wife and had another family. This information comes from a divorce suit which Mary filed in 1880.<br><br>In 1870, Mary and her two year old daughter, Jennie, were living with E. O. Michie, who described his occupation as ""retired merchant"" and Luther Dunn, 23, ""merchant."" She was keeping house for the two men. E. O. Michie was one of the sons of Beau Jim Michie of Longwood.  Perkins Evans had been enslaved by Beau Jim Michie during the dangerous time when Perkins and two other slaves, Henry, slave of D. H. Lupton, and Moton, Col. Thomas Durrett Jr.'s slave, had been accused of breaking, entering and stealing $20.25 worth of bank notes from Samuel Madison, a White shoemaker, on December 24, 1861. The case had been declared ""Noli, prosi qui"", or not prosecuted, the first week of January, 1862, with the assent of those contestees when the slave owners paid all expenses attending the court case.<br><br>After ten years of abandonment, Mary filed for divorce in 1880. Edward Ray's brother, Perkins Ray, testified that he had left her without cause. Perkins Ray, married to Kitty Whipps, another former Bleak House slave,  stated that he had known Mary and her husband, his brother, all his life. Adam Whipps, Kitty’s father, testified that he had lived on the same plantation with them after Mary and Edward had been married, probably the Chestnut Avenue or Locust Grove plantations near  Bleak House land. Both stated that Mary had given no cause to be abandoned, and that she had received no support from Edward after he left their home. She was granted the divorce, and it was stipulated that Edward was to have no relationship with his daughter, Jennie. He did not seem to want one. After moving to Charleston, West Virginia, around 1870, he had been back to the Charlottesville area only once and, Adam Whips testified, ""he never went to see her or had anything to do with her. I do not believe that he ever saw her during that visit."" (Albemarle Chancery, Mary Ray vs Edward Ray, 1880-007cc, Library of Virginia.)<br><br>After her divorce, Mary reclaimed her maiden name Evans. In the 1880 census, she had moved back to live with Mariah and Perkins Evans. She was 32 and Jennie was 12, both used the Evans name. Next door lived her brother Nathaniel, his wife Mary, and their small daughter, Beatrice. It would have been a comforting place to be for Mary and Jennie after the difficulties of abandonment and divorce.<br><br>Mary Evans' great nephew, Ross Evans, knew about her and spoke of Aunt Mary Ray and his cousin Jennie. <br><br> Jennie Ray at some time moved to Richmond, VA where on July 3, 1890 she married Louis/Lewis Green (b. 1865 to Jacob and Lucinda Green of Petersburg, VA.)  Louis was 25 when he married and Jennie 18.  In 1900, he was a waiter in a restaurant, and he and Jennie owned their home on N. 20th St. in Richmond.  Ten years later, he was still working as a waiter but in a hotel.  Jennie was not working, but she did have a daughter, Ruby, who had been born in 1895.  Although Ruby did not appear on the 1900 census, the written entry on the census for children in 1900 appears to have been filled in at a different time by the census taker, so there may have been an error of omission at the time the census taker was visiting the house.  Louis and Jennie appear to have died between 1910-1912, a period when no death records for Virginia were filed.  They are not on the 1920 census.  Ruby would have been about 17 when they died.<br><br> Ruby married in 1914, Zacharias D. Lewis, Jr. (1893-1914).  He was the son of Zacharias D. Lewis Sr. who was a pastor at the2nd African Baptist Church and vice-president of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. Zacharias, the younger, and probably Ruby, lived with his parents while young Zachariais worked as a funeral director.  Ruby divorced him on the grounds of adultery in 1919.  They had had one child, a daughter born in 1916 and named Dorothy Atalanta Lewis. In 1920, Ruby Green worked as a waitress in a cafeteria.  She lived with William and Mary Truhart who described Ruby as a stepdaughter and little Dorothy as their granddaughter, but this seems a fictive relationship. Before the 1930 census, Ruby married Chester Carter,(b. 1883-d.1938) described as a beneficial insurance inspector.  Ruby worked as a waitress in a drugstore. When Chester died, Ruby seems to have gone to college.  By 1940, two years after his death, she was 45 years old, had attended school the past year and was a salaried government employee working as a teacher in adult education.  In 1942, Ruby married Samuel Fife.  Mary Evans Ray had been remembered by her great nephew, Ross Evans, as Aunt Mary, and his son, Jim Evans had been told that Jennie Ray had married a Fife.  It was not Jennie who married the Fife, but her daughter Ruby.  Samuel Fife was a Pullman porter,( b. 1893- D. 1973) His draft card stated he had had two years of college.  Ruby died 5 years after Samuel Fife.  <br><br> Ruby’s daughter, Dorothy Atalanta Lewis followed her mother’s pattern in distinctive ways.  She was married first in 1939 to Robert Lee Barco (b. 1911) who worked as a bartender.  By 1940, Dorothy had already completed 4 years of college.  Barco sued her for divorce in 1946 on the grounds of desertion.  At this time, Dorothy was a student at Columbia University .  She married in 1950, James Farer (b. 1925), who was almost a decade younger than herself. He was a biologist from Philadelphia.  Their marriage ended in 1954 when he deserted her.  A year later a Richmond directory showed Dorothy Farer had become a teacher at Virginia Union University in Richmond.  She died in 1994, the last of Mary Evans Ray’s descendants.",http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2657/5727607269_ddd3608bb9.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After his marriage, both Charles and Fannie were working at the Farish Hotel, he as a “hotel servant"" and she as a “nurse.” The Farish Hotel was opposite to the public square in Charlottesville.

He was the youngest son of Armstead and Lucy Woodfolk and the first of the Bleak House enslaved to leave Albemarle County, self-emancipating before the end of the Civil War, perhaps during the aftermath of Custer’s Raid on Rio Mills in February, 1864. <br><br> Although his obituary states that he enlisted in Company E of the 38th infantry of the District of Columbia Volunteers ""at the outbreak of the Civil War"", the record of his mustering into this company said he joined March 7, 1865 in Washington, D.C., a month before Lincoln’s assassination.  John Woodfolk was 21 years old, 5’4"", with ""copper""- colored skin and black eyes and hair, according to his enlistment document. His unit served in Brownsville, Texas near the Mexican border and  Brazos Santiago, Texas which was used by the Union troops, primarily the US Colored Troops, as a landing and staging area after Texas surrendered in May of 1865.  Woodfolk would have been in Texas to experience the announcement on June 2, 1865 when the enslaved there learned of their freedom, an event we now recognize as Juneteenth. On March 8, 1866, Woodfolk was discharged at Brazos Santiago and ""transportation and subsistence"" furnished for him to travel to Galveston, Texas. By then, he had $75.79 due to him in pay, his last pay having been given to him December 31, 1865.  A note in his military records says that his name  ""appears also as Woodfolk, ""  although he was to choose to spell his surname Woodford, unlike any other member of his family. (fold3 records)<br><br> By 1870, he appeared in the Washington D.C. census. The year before, he had married Hattie Burk on September 11, 1869 in Washington, (DC  Marriage Licenses Register 2, 1858-1870, compiled by Wesley E. Pippenger, Willow Band Books, Lovettsville, Va. 1996, p 323.) Hattie, or Harriet, had been born in Virginia. Hattie gave her son the middle name Burke to honor her family. She may have been already living in Washington when John arrived from his military service in Texas.<br><br>In the 1870 census entry, John Woodfork and his wife were living with Caroline Davis, born in 1822, who was a Messenger at the Treasury Department. Carolyn Davis owned $1000 in real estate and $100 in personal property, the only person on this census page to own anything large enough to be noted. Carolyn was designated as a mulatto as were the two young men with her, Charles, 21, and John Davis, 8. Charles was also working as a messenger in the same government office and little John was at school. John Woodfork, 26, was working as a ""waiter in Hotel"" his wife Harriet, 22, as a laundress. Caroline was not able to read or write, but John Woodfork was literate.<br><br>Who was Caroline Davis? The Freedman Bank records show Caroline Davis, born in Prince William, Va., deposited $150 dollars in 1870. She was noted as mulatto with two children, John R. and Charles William. Charles William apparently made the deposit and there is a note that he could draw on the account. In the 1860 census, Charles Davis, mulatto, born in VA and living in Prince William County, VA.,was living with Hampton Gaskins, 55, and a farmer, Sarah, 55, Richard and Frank Stokes. Frank, 19, was born in DC. Gaskins may have been Caroline Davis' father. Caroline was living in Alexandria, VA. in this census. She appears to have been a Free Person of Color.<br><br>Whatever the relationship between Caroline Davis and John Woodfolk, she may have  helped him get work in the highly desirable, respected and secure world of government service. By the 1880 census, John was employed as a messenger at the Supreme Court. The family had grown and now included Elizabeth, 10, Carrie, 7, and a son, Eugene, 4. All children were born in DC. Carrie appears on another census as Carolyn, so she was likely named to honor Carolyn Davis, the family's benefactress.  Both daughters were ill with whooping cough, the 1880 census notes, and both were going to school. <br><br>It is in this census that John Woodfork changed the spelling of his name to Woodford, while other members of his family shifted the name's spelling between Woodfolk and Woodfork, and even Woodfork. John’s children continued to spell their surname ""Woodford"" as their father had. <br><br>John's brother Armstead and his wife Mary were staying with John and his family in the 1880 census perhaps until they could get oriented to life in the city. Armstead identified himself as a brick mason and his wife as a servant.<br><br> Frank Whipps was also living with the Woodford family at this time. Frank, 25, worked as a laborer. He was John and Armstead’s  nephew, the son of their sister Cynthia  Woodfolk Whipps, now deceased.<br><br>By 1900, the Woodfords were living with just the nuclear family. Hattie reported that of the 6 children she had borne only 3 were alive. Those children were living with them, Lizzie, 29, who was a dressmaker, Carrie, 26 and Eugene, 23, who was working as a ""vallet."" John Woodford was no longer a simple messenger at the Supreme Court. He was now a doorkeeper there, and worked for a regular wage. He and Hattie had been married 31 years, all of them spent in Washington, DC.<br><br>The 1910 census shows the family was living at 1207 S. Street. Two of the Woodfords worked in government jobs, John as doorkeeper to the Supreme Court, Eugene as a laborer in the Government Printing Office. Elizabeth worked at home as a dressmaker and Carolyn as a maid for ""Indien"", whatever that might have meant. With the family was a niece, Ruth W. Southall, 17. She had been born in Iowa, but her father, a coal miner there, had been born in Virginia. Ruth attended Howard, later returning to Iowa for a degree and getting a masters at Alabama State. She married a mail carrier, Harry A. Boyd and lived in Alabama with him, teaching in the Selma schools and retired as an English professor in 1965.  How she was related, I have been unable to determine, but most likely through her father, Charles Grandison Southall who was born in VA. Her presence shows the Woodfords continued to open their home to help new arrivals who came to Washington. During his time in Washington, DC, Woodford undoubtedly helped those who had come there-- his brother Armistead, his sister Judy Reed and her children, Constancia, Rebecca and Elizabeth, and Henry Reed, as well as his sister Cynthia’s son Frank Whipps and his ""niece"" Ruth Southall.  Interestingly, John Woodford, although now 69, told the 1910 census taker he had attended school in the past year.<br><br> Hattie Woodford died Oct. 1915. Her  closed casket service was held at Walker Memorial Baptist Church.  The 1920 census showed that  Eugene worked as a clerk for the government, and his father still worked as a doorkeeper. They lived at 2029 13th St, NW, DC. The neighborhood appears to be filled with other African American government workers, teachers, clerks, a dentist and a fireman.<br><br>In April, 1929, daughter Carrie, or Carolyn Woodford died suddenly, and  three months later, July 2, her father, John Woodford died. He was 88 and the sad news was on the front page of the Evening Star in Washington, DC., ""FUNERAL SERVICES HELD FOR JOHN L. WOODFORD.""  The article lauded him as the ""Colored Employe at Supreme Court for Half Century Served in Civil War,"" and continued, ""He was appointed a messenger to the Supreme Court in 1876 by the late Associate Justice Samuel F. Miller of Iowa, and had been personally acquainted with every justice of the court and many members of Congress since that time, and is believed to have been the oldest man in point of service at the Capitol."" ( Evening Star, Washington, District of Columbia, Friday July 5, 1929) John, his wife Hattie, and their daughter Carrie were all buried in Harmony Cemetery. <br><br>Woodford was survived by his son Eugene and daughter Elizabeth. Eugene, a ""skilled helper"" at the General Printing Office, his wife Inez and his sister Elizabeth continued to live together as they always had. Inez and Eugene do not appear to have had any children, nor did his sister, who never married. Eugene died in 1966 and Inez in 1988.",http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2590/5727245837_9d40ea465e.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s30,story,,,Link Evans,"Link [Nathaniel] Evans<br>1850 - 1932<br><br>The inventory and appraisal of the estate of James B. Rogers in 1863 includes the entry ""Link,13, value $2000."" This is Link, or Nathaniel, Evans, Mariah Evans' son, born in 1850. He grew up to be a well-respected and successful blacksmith and landowner. In present day Earlysville, Albemarle County there is a road named after him.<br><br>The census of 1870 is the census in which the Evans family appears twice, living in different locations. One was on the Bleak House land, or near it, the other in Earlysville. Link Jennins, (Evans) appears in one with his family and all are working as farmers; this is the rural Bleak House entry. In the other entry, the name appears as Ivins, and the family was living in Earlysville where Perkins Evans was working as a blacksmith.  Here Link is called by his formal name, Nathaniel. <br><br>Perkins Evans had been a blacksmith when he was enslaved by the Michie family, appearing as the only slave with a noted profession in the 1857 inventory of Beau Jim Michie of Longwood. Link became Perkins' apprentice and was the blacksmith for the town of Earlysville. He continued to work as a blacksmith until 1920 and his death certificate gives it as his profession.<br><br>Link Evans was a farmer as well as blacksmith, and appeared as a ""general farmer"" on the 1920 census, no longer as a blacksmith. By this census,  he was 70 years old.  He first bought land in 1877 and continued to acquire acreage. At one time his landholdings may have amounted to about 150 acres. Some of this land he sold or gave to family members.<br><br>In the censuses of 1870 and 1880, Link stated he could neither read nor write, but after 1900, he had become literate. Having been enslaved, his education had been very different from the woman he married in 1878, Mary Thomas Sammons. She was the daughter of Free Persons of Color who had educated their children.  One of her brothers, Jesse Sammons, was an important figure  in the Charlottesville area, a teacher, the first principal of Albemarle Training School, and a politician. Her father was Rollins Sammons who ran a mill at Hydraulic. He was a member of the Charlottesville Baptist Church. Mary's mother was Sarah Bell Scott.<br><br>Sarah Bell Scott was descended from Elizabeth (Betty) Hemings' daughter, Mary Hemings Bell, sister to Sally Hemings, who was almost certainly the mother of a number of Thomas Jefferson's children. Mary Hemings Bell was purchased from Monticello in 1792 by her common law husband, a White merchant named Thomas Bell and freed by him. One of her two children, born before she was emancipated, was named Sarah, or Sally. Sally married a prominent musician, Jesse Scott, and had three sons, one being Robert Scott. Robert Scott married Nancy Redcross and one of their children was Sarah Bell Scott, who married Rollins Sammons on January 2, 1847. Sarah Bell Scott was born enslaved, because her mother Nancy was still a slave, but her father had given her her freedom in 1838, when she was about 13. Link and Mary Sammons Evans named their second daughter, born in 1881, after Mary's mother. She was called Sarah Belle.<br><br>Link and Mary Thomas Sammons Evans had four children. The first child, their daughter Beatrice, was born in 1879 and married George M. Rives in 1904. They moved to Raleigh, West Virginia and George worked as a coal miner, a job normally closed to Blacks. The Rives lived in a White neighborhood and were listed as White in the 1910 census. Their son, Leon, was born in West Virginia in 1905. Beatrice contracted tuberculosis and may have returned to her parents during her final illness, because she died in Virginia. She is buried in the Evans family graveyard. <br><br George Rives/Reeves/Reaves then married a woman, Mary, who raised her stepson, Leon, with great kindness. In 1920, George was working as a draper in a dry goods store and later became an interior decorator.  Leon went to West Virginia State and then Howard Law School where he was a classmate of Thurgood Marshall’s.  Leon was married twice, first to Esther Page by whom he had a son and then to Lola Burton who helped to raise the child.  Leon visited his uncles William and Roscoe Evans, and on one occasion, Roscoe wrote out the family tree for him and tried to explain it.   <br><br>The Evans' second daughter, Sarah Belle, died when she was 22. On a visit to West Virginia to be with her uncle, Calvin Evans, and his family,  she  met and fell in love with a man who stood her up on their wedding day.  He was, according to a family story shared by Jim Evans, ""a man from a well-to-do family.  They owned coal-bearing land.  On their wedding day he didn’t show and her 1st cousin, ...Angus, went looking for him with a shotgun only to find that he had run away with another woman."" Sarah Belle returned to Earlysville, and two years later contracted tuberculosis and died of pneumonia in 1903.  She is buried in the Evans family cemetery.<br><br>Link and Mary's two sons, William, born in 1885, and Roscoe, born in 1887, probably did not have children. William's middle name was Lovett, the maiden name of Link and Mary Evans' sister-in-law, Marcia Lovett Evans, who married Link's brother William Bernard Evans. Marcia Lovett was, like Mary Sammons, a well educated Free Person of Color, and the two sisters-in-law must have been very fond of each other. <br><br>William Lovett Evans was living in Roxbury, MA, when he registered for the draft in 1917. He worked as a waiter in Healys Hotel in Boston. The draft card notes that William had suffered the ""loss of eye by accident"" but in 1920 he was working in Springfield, MA as a toolmaker in a magnet factory. He had married the year before to Marie, who worked as an elevator operator. They lived in a neighborhood full of immigrants, and both listed themselves as White. They were living among people who were jealously guarding whatever status they had as White people and who were vigilant to exclude Blacks from their neighborhood. In 1930, they remained in Massachusetts, living in Springfield. William was a doorman in a hotel. Both are listed as negro, the only people of color on the census page of 50 residents. They had had no children.<br><br>Roscoe Conkling Evans had been given his name to honor Roscoe Conkling, a flamboyant and controversial Radical Republican politician from New York who was known for his unwavering support of African Americans during Reconstruction. One of his most dramatic moves was to propose that land be taken from former slaveholders and distributed to freed slaves. In 1915, Roscoe's WW1 draft card was issued in Huntington, West Virginia. He was working as a ""pool room porter"" and he was described as of medium height, medium complexion and brown hair. By 1920, he was back in Earlysville living with his parents, and in 1930, he and his father were living alone together. Roscoe farmed the Evans’ land. He never married and died in 1964.<br><br>Mary Thomas Sammons Evans died in 1927 and Link in 1932. They are buried next to each other and beside their two daughters who had predeceased them.<br><br>Only the deaths of prominent African Americans were printed in the Daily Progress, Charlottesville's White newspaper, and Nathaniel's death information appeared in September, 1932, ""Nathaniel Evans, well known resident of the Earlysville area, died Tuesday in his home after an extended illness."" His son Roscoe had reported his death and he was buried, according to his death certificate, at the ""Home Place."" He had died shortly after his 82nd birthday, on September 27, 1932.<br><br>A road off Buck Mountain Road in Earlysville  is called Link Evans Lane. It is here that he had his farm and his blacksmith forge. His home still stands and the Evans family graveyard is across the lane from his house at the corner of Link Evans Lane and Fence Road.<br><br>In the 1990's the rural roads were given names in addition to their route numbers. Members of the community around Link Evans’ house asked that the road beside it be named after him. The letter to the authorities in charge of the naming process reads, ""He (Link Evans) was much admired: his house and garden were regarded as the most attractive in Earlysville. The people still alive who know him all speak of his fine character and of his industry. ""<br><br> The letter also explained that  Link Evans was also the only"" negro"" member of Earlysville ""invited to vote"" by the community, a rare thing in the Jim Crow Era. George Golden, who lived on land adjoining the Bleak House property, remembered the Evans family as ""light skinned people with straight hair."" He said that Link had attended both the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church and Mt. Sinai Church, churches which held services on alternating Sundays. Oral history from the Evans family recalls he was hardworking and rarely spoke.  Mildred Garrison, remembered him as a very old man when she was a tiny child. She grew up on a property near Link Evans' home called Happy Hollow in Earlysville.<br><br>Beatrice Evans Rives' son, Leon, eventually inherited his grandfather's land. He supervised renting and upkeep on the house, but it was later sold and developed into an area called ""The Pines."" <br><br> In 2015, Leon Reaves’ son and his family visited  Link Evans’ home and the family cemetery as well as Bleak House. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/LinkEvansShop.jpg) (Link Evans and his shop, photo courtesy of Phil James, Secrets of the Blue Ridge)",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1322/5098221031_9a60ecf292.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She arrived as an eight year old at their home in 1849 following Henry Reed in 1845 and Ellen in 1847.  <br><br> A. C. Wood reported the birth of a son, William, to her in 1860.  She may be ""Jane Tinsley"" in the 1870 census.  Jane Tinsley and husband Dabney had a son William, born in 1863, and Jane’s age, 27, is close to the age calculation from the date she arrived in the Woods household.  In the 1870 census, Jane and her family lived near H. O. Austin, which was close to Dr. A. C. Woods’ former home.

s34,story,,,Molly Whipps,"Molly/ Mary Whipps 1857-1939 <br><br> Molly was born to Adam and Cynthia Whipps at Bleak House.  She was around 13 when her mother died leaving several young children behind, one of them a baby.  Adam remarried soon after his wife’s death, and Maggie, his second wife, had two children, Rosa and Lena, before she died five years later. <br><br>In 1880, Molly married Millard Thomas in Charlottesville, at the home of Adam and his third wife, Phyllis, Whipps.  Millard, son of Thomas and Caroline, was a laborer.  The couple lived on Commerce Street with the extended family there, but three years later, Mollie’s husband died of consumption and Adam Whipps reported it.  She did not marry again and had no children. <br><br> Over the next several censuses, Mollie lived with her father and stepmother, and her half-sisters, Lena and Rosa.  She did not learn the dressmaking skills that Phyllis taught Maggie’s girls. Perhaps she worked tending the house for the extended family. <br><br>Molly must have cared for Adam and Phyllis and her half-sisters, Lena and Rosa, during their final illnesses. After their deaths, Mollie continued to live in the family house where she enjoyed a life tenancy, perhaps in recognition for the care she had given the family over the years.  She died Feb. 10, 1939,  and left her share of the soon-to-be settled estate of her parents to her niece Viola Brooks, daughter of her brother, Benjamin, and to her nephew Charles Estes, son of her sister Fannie.  Charles had  been living in the house on Commerce Street with her.<br><br> She is buried at Oakwood Cemetery.",http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2797/5727699517_bfc168a23f.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s35,story,,,Connie Reed,"Connie Reed 1851-1928 <br><br> Connie or Constancia Reed was a daughter of Allen and Judy Reed.  In 1863, when she was about 12, she was ""given"" to James B. Rogers’s son, W. G. Rogers.  She joined her sister Rebecca who had been in that household for about 7 years.  The Civil War was being fought and James B. Rogers died in the year she was sent to live with his son, but the two sisters would have been together to support each other although they had been separated from their parents.<br><br> Two years later, Emancipation returned the daughters to their home.<br><br> In 1870, Constancia, 19, appeared in the census living with her parents and working, like sisters Elizabeth and Ada, as a domestic servant. She had married Abraham Brown May 27, 1868 and the 10 month old baby in the adjoining household, Alice Brown, was their child.  ""Abram"", or Abraham, had worked for Warner Wood who lived at Farmington, and this was where Connie’s parents and family had moved after Emancipation.<br><br>By 1872, Connie was in New York where her second child, Junius Brown, was born.  Abraham worked there as a waiter.  But her marriage to Brown did not work out and in 1876 she had returned to Albemarle County and remarried.  Her second husband, Nelson Carr, was a dairyman and a widower, more than 10 years older, with several children.  They married at Farmington where Nelson may have been working. In 1880, their household held Nelson and Connie, who was working as a washerwoman, and three of Nelson’s children, although her own son, Junius, was living with his Reed grandparents.<br><br>By 1885, Connie and Nelson Carr had moved to Mahaska, Iowa, following in the footsteps of his brother, Joseph Carr, and Connie’s uncle, Nelson Woodfolk, as well as some Walker cousins of hers. No children, either hers or his, seem to have gone with them. Initially, Nelson worked as a miner, but moved before 1900 to Muscatine, Iowa, where his brother Joseph  had settled. Joseph Carr, had been a Muscatine resident since at least 1878 when he had married there.  Joseph had been born in Charlottesville, VA, had escaped from slavery and joined the Union Army in Rhode Island in 1863, fighting until the end of the Civil War.  Connie’s uncle, John Woodford, had also fought with the Union forces.<br><br>The town of Muscatine was described as ""one of the finest little towns in Iowa"" by a friend of the Carrs, J.P. Sheffy, writing for the African American paper, the Iowa State Bystander, in 1900.  Sheffy wrote that he had visited friends there who ""once worked in the mines of Muchakinock, (and) now own their own property.  Nelson Carr has a four room house and five acres and one buggy and one cow.""  He also noted Carr’s property was valued at $1,100. Another mention in the Bystander, August 3, 1900 says (in)"" Muscatine...the colored people are doing more in the way of agricultural pursuits. Nelson Carr...and his wife are Christian people and much interested in the progress of the race."" A year later, Nelson put on a 10x14 kitchen, ""the beauty of it is he did the work himself. Everything is kept picked up and in good order around his premises,"" (Muscatine Journal, 22 January, 1901.) Some years later, the Bystander (26, July , 1907) reported Nelson was ""doing well on his beautiful farm.  He is a true type of race man and a pleasant gentleman to meet."" <br><br> The 1900 census shows that Connie and Nelson Carr were caring for twelve year old Eva Walker, Connie’s cousin Charles Walker’s daughter.  Eva’s mother, Lydia Gilette Walker, had died in 1896. (See Sophia Walker) Junius Brown, Connie’s son by her first marriage, came from New York and visited his mother in 1900.  While going into town together, their horse was frightened and ran away.  The buggy they were riding in was ""demolished"" and Connie was badly bruised.  Connie’s other child, Alice Brown, had died by this time, and within the next ten years, Junius had died.<br><br>Connie Carr’s life in Iowa was a socially active one. She entertained  in both Muscatine and Muchakinock, traveling between the two communities. She was a member of the Dunbar Club (Muscatine Journal, May 8, 1903) which gathered and discussed ""The Emancipated Negro: of His Progress Since January 1, 1863""  at one of their meetings.  She was  one of only two guests at the wedding of her close friend, Leilia Sheffey, when she married Dr. Summer Taylor, a Harvard educated doctor, who practiced in Buxton, Iowa.  Leilia Sheffey was ""the only colored woman...appointed by a judge to do official repertorial work in the courts of Iowa."" (Ottomwa Tri-Weekly Courier, November 13, 1906) A description of an entertainment at the Carr’s ""suburban"" home noted  ""Dinner and supper was served… Ice cream and cake was served in plenty.  The evening was spent with music and song.  Mr (Isaac) Trusty brought out his old violin and entertained the company with the old fashioned melodies that was really enjoyed, bringing memories of by gone days.  All departed regretting that such a pleasant day and evening had ended."" (Iowa State Bystander, August 17, 1906) A few months later, the Carrs celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary with another party in Muscatine.<br><br> There are no more entries about the pleasant life the Carrs lived on their farm in  Iowa. In April of 1910 when the federal census was taken, Nelson and Connie Carr were in Tacoma, Washington.  They had made a journey of almost 2,000 miles from their home in Muscatine. In Tacoma, they lived in a house they owned, together with two"" friends"", Isaac, 46, and his son, 14 year old Alphonso Trusty.  Connie was 56 and working as a chambermaid in a hotel, and Nelson, then 72, stated he had not been out of work all year, although no occupation was listed for him.  Isaac Trusty was the same man who had played ""his old violin"" back in Muscatine, entertaining at the Carrs’ home during the ""pleasant day and evening.""  He was working as a hotel waiter.  Why had these people left Iowa?<br><br>Nelson Carr died in Tacoma, WA on the first of June, 1913.  He is buried in the ""old"" Tacoma cemetery.  His grave is unmarked, but identified with a small stone #213. ( Chad Schneider, the find-a-grave member who photographed his stone, said that it was under about 4 inches of earth and is in a section of the graveyard where most burials are for those without families.) <br><br> Connie Carr did not stay in Tacoma after Carr’s death, but moved to Chehalis, WA where Isaac Trusty operated a shoe shine stand.  Trusty was hit by a car while crossing the street in front of his stand.  He sued for compensation for his injuries and was awarded $10,000.  He died in 1917, and perhaps Connie Carr shared in his award. By 1920, Connie had returned to Tacoma and worked as a laundress.  That same year she married again, this time to Anthony Day, a janitor, but he lived only two years after they wed and sometime after his death in 1922 she left Tacoma. <br><br>Connie Reed Carr Day died in Washington, DC in 1928.  She had left the West coast and started life again in a new city connecting there, surely, with her uncle John Woodford.  Two of her siblings had moved to Washington, DC, but her brother Henry Reed had died in 1902,  and her sister, Rebecca Rives, in 1917 before she had arrived.  Connie Day died at her residence, 2029 13th St. N. W., and her funeral service was held at Walker Memorial Baptist Church.  She was buried at Harmony Cemetery, the resting place for her sister, and soon to be where her uncle John Woodford would be interred, although their graves would be dug up and their markers lost when the cemetery was moved to make way for a subway stop.(see Benjamin Whipps). <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/ConnieHouse.jpg) (Connie and Nelson Carr's home in Takoma, WA.

She married at her parents’ home in 1876 when she was 20 to Vick Rives, 21, son of Ryland and Susan Rives.  Vick was likely Bickerton Rives, who on the 1870 census was working “on the railroad,” although when he married he was working as a barber.

He was the youngest of Mariah's children and the only one of her children who would have been born around the time that the Rogers family moved to Bleak House in 1854. He was valued at $1000, less than Ada, who was also 8, but more than Lucy or Cornelia. These children were all the same age. He was called"" Bernard"" in this record. He is listed on the index of slave births born to Mariah. His name is misrepresented as Bennett. Bernard was pronounced ""Buh-Nud"" which sounds very much like Bennett.<br>In the 1870 census, Bernard appears on both census entries that the Evans family were on, the farming location and that of the blacksmith shop. He was 16. Six years later he had moved to West Virginia and was living at Harpers Ferry. <br><br>Storer College had opened its doors in 1867 and admitted its first students. It was established to educate former slaves, and it was clearly what had drawn William Bernard Evans to Harpers Ferry. In 1876, he married Marcia Lovett. She was already a 1872 graduate of Storer. <br><br>Marcia Lovett’s parents, William C. Lovett and Sarah Elizabeth Weaver Lovett, were Free Persons of Color from Winchester, Frederick, Virginia. They appear in both the 1850 and 1860 census, in the first, living with Sarah's parents, the Weavers. By 1860, William Lovett owned real estate valued at $1000 and personal property valued at $75. He was working as a day laborer, neither he nor his wife were literate. By the 1870 census, all of their 10 children, except the 4 year old, were in school and all but one could both read and write.<br><br>In 1880, all the Lovett family was living in Harpers Ferry. William and Sarah Lovett were running a boarding house. Etta, their 19 year old daughter, was a school teacher and so was their 22 year old son, John P. Lovett. Three boarders lived with them, all were White. One was an ""authoress"" Aurelia H. Mohl, from Mississippi, who was there with her sister and her niece, Priscilla and Aurelia Key. The boarding house appears to have been next to the college, because the following census entry is for Storer College and the principal of the school and his wife, who was a teacher there. The entries after that are under the same census entry number and all are college residents.<br><br>Storer was the first African American college in West Virginia and it was situated in a symbolic place, Harpers Ferry, the site of John Brown's Raid. The school was never accredited and enrollment peaked at around 400. However, it was an important center of learning and thought. Frederick Douglass delivered a speech about John Brown at Storer in 1881, and in 1921, W. E. Dubois began to develop the Niagara Movement there, which was the genesis of the NAACP.  Storer closed its doors in 1955 after the Desegregation ruling. <br><br>A motto on Storer letterhead read, ""A Door of Hope, for Poor, but Worthy, Women and Men."" Teachers were both Black and White. However, in a commemorative book about Storer, a photo is included and an inscription from the back of the picture reads, ""Taken at White Teachers Dining Hall.""<br><br>William Bernard Evans graduated from Storer in 1878, two years after he married.  He and Marcia had 7 children, three of them girls. All the girls graduated from Storer. <br><br>William Bernard and Marcia were teachers and William Bernard rose to be principal of the school for Black children in Bolivar, the section where African Americans lived.<br><br>Marcia's sister, Margaretta Daniels, moved in with the Evans when she was widowed. She continued to be proprietress of a hotel called Lockwood House, perhaps one that had developed from the boarding house her parents ran. Margaretta had married Allen Preston Daniel and their son was Allen Mercer Daniel, later a dean of Howard law school and a law librarian.<br><br>William Bernard Evans had only one arm. A family descendant recalled that he had lost it in a farm accident. Perhaps this was the reason he was sent to Storer, the only one of the Evans family at this period to get an education.  A story about Professor Frank Trigg, 1850-1933, of Lynchburg relates that he had lost his arm at 15 in a farming accident. He had been enslaved by John Floyd,  a governor of Virginia.  John Floyd had said, ""since he was no more good with his hands, he'd see how good he could be with his head, "" (information from signage at Lynchburg Public Cemetery.) Trigg was sent to Hampton Institute where he became a friend of Booker T. Washington.<br><br>William Bernard Evans died March 25, 1921 in Harpers Ferry and was buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery on Old Furnace Road, Bolivar, West Virginia. Marcia Evans died in May of 1926. <br><br>Two of their children, Meta,1891- 1930, and Sarah Lois, 1883-1966, have left living descendants.  Meta's descendants live in California and New Hampshire. Lois's descendant lives in California, as does one of Meta’s. Both descendants from California have visited Bleak House. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/WilliamBernardEvans.jpg) (William Bernard Evans and his wife, Marcia Lovett, photo courtesy of James Evans)",http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/5730863862_9f7143440a.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s38,story,,,Cornelia Bibb,"Cornelia Bibb 1855-1870+  Cornelia, daughter of Rose, was born in 1855 and her birth reported by James B. Rogers. Her name may show a connection with those enslaved by the Michie family. Cornelia was the name of one of Beau Jim Michie’s children and a woman enslaved there, Cornelia Walker. <br><br> Cornelia was 8 years old when she was listed on Rogers’ estate inventory and worth $800.  Her mother Rose had died before the inventory was taken in 1863.  Rose had had two other children, James, who died in 1852, and his brother Nelson, who died of dysentery in 1858.  Cornelia may have been orphaned and without siblings and may have been adopted by the Bibb family. Perhaps Rose and Peachy Bibb were sisters. Naming one of her sons "" Nelson"", may mean Rose was a Woodfolk and had named the child after her brother, Nelson Woodfolk.  <br><br> In 1870, Cornelia appeared in two locations in the Albemarle census.  She was working as a domestic servant living with a wealthy dry goods merchant from South Carolina, W. S. Comer,  and his family. She was also living with others from the Bleak House plantation at the home of Edmund Murray (see Isaetta and Mary Ann Bibb) in the vicinity of Farmington.  In this census entry, Cornelia is placed separately from the Murray family and carries the Bibb name, although the two children of Peachy and John Bibb, Isaetta and Mary Ann, are listed as Murrays.  Cornelia was 15 at the time of this census.   I have been unable to find further information about her life.",http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2158/5730852696_13dcf13677.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among those giving birth were  Peachy, whose baby was  Lucy, and ""Cinthia""   (Whipps) whose child was Sally.  However, fifteen years later, Lucy was living in the household of widowed Adam Whipps.  Why?  Had she been adopted by the Whipps family?   Both Adam’s wife Cynthia and Peachy had died between  Roger’s death in 1863 when they were recorded on the inventory of his estate and before the 1870 census.  There seems to be no way to know who Lucy’s mother was, but she considered herself a Whipps.<br><br>In 1878, Lucy married Joshua Rives, son of Robert and Lucinda, and gave her parents’ names as Cythia and Adam Whipps. Joshua worked as a cook, and their first child, Lewis was born in 1880. The Rives ( Reeves/ Rieves/ Reives/ Reaves) family lived  with Adam Whips and his extended family on Commerce Street in Charlottesville.  At the time of the 1880 census, Rose and Lena Whips, children of Adam’s deceased second wife Maggie, were in the Rives household, along with their own baby Lewis.<br><br> Other children were born in Virginia, Mabel, Belle, Annie and Mattie, but I’ve been unable to find the family on a census until 1915, by which time,  Mattie had taken the name Finney and had two children, called her ""wards,""  had moved to New York city, and was living with her sister, Mabel Reaves.  By 1920, Lucy was widowed and heading up the New York household.  Lucy, then 52, worked as a laundress and Mabel, now Mabel Freeman, did housework for a private family, and a few years later worked as a ""ribboner."" Mattie had three children, Joseph, b. 1912, Emmett, b. 1914, and Anita, b. 1917. <br><br> Lucy died in 1927, and her daughter Mattie in 1936.

Rogers, who had been ""given"" Sophia two years earlier, reported the birth of a female child to her.  Yet Alice, 5 years old, was recorded in the inventory of Rogers’ Bleak House estate in 1863, separated from her mother.  Perhaps she was visiting her grandmother, Lucy Woodfolk, and her Woodfolk cousins at the time the inventory was taken.  Perhaps there was an agreement between W. G. Rogers and his father that Alice would go to Bleak House. We do not know.<br><br>  Emancipation returned her to her Walker family and she was living with her parents and siblings in the 1870 census.  By 1884, she was in Iowa, probably following her brother, Charles Walker, who had gone to Muchakinock by 1882, and was a miner.  Going by the name Mary, Alice married Wilson W. Cary, born the same year in Albemarle County, Virginia as she had been.  He was the son of Wilson and Harriet Fergeson Cary.  Wilson, like Alice’s uncle and brothers, was a coal miner.   Wilson died in 1903. <br><br> By 1910, Alice had moved to Topeka, Kansas with her youngest son, Talmage, who worked in a machine shop for the railroad. After returning from Kansas to Buxton, Talmage worked for a time as a coal miner.  Alice and her son moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota by 1920.

She was valued at $450, the same as the two other 4 year olds, Isitta and Dick, who lived at Bleak House. <br><br>Josie, or Josephine, was the daughter of Angelina Evans and Charles Preston Burley. Angelina was Mariah Evans' daughter, and Charles was enslaved on a nearby plantation. Josephine was born in 1859 after the Rogers had moved to Bleak House. Perhaps the move had brought Angelina and Charles Burley into proximity.<br><br>At the time of the 1870 census, Angelina and Charles had 4 children, Josie was the oldest, 12, and Mariah, or Ann Maria as she appeared on the Inventory of 1863, was 8. Two brothers, Robert, 4, and Charles, 2, had been born since Emancipation. Charles Burley, Sr. was 40, and working on a farm, probably either on land at Bleak House, Chestnut Avenue or Locust Grove. The family was close to Mariah and Perkins Evans and the Whipps family. Josie also appears in the entry with Mariah and Perkins at their blacksmith shop in Earlysville. She would have been visiting her grandmother and aunts and uncles who lived there,<br><br>When Josephine was about 19 she married  Peter Cobbs. By the 1880 census the couple was working together in a hotel run by John Eubanks in Warm Springs, Bath, Virginia. Peter was working as a servant, and she as a chambermaid in the hotel. Peter Cobbs' brother, Thomas and his wife Eliza were also working there. Josie’s younger brother Price Burley was in Bath, too, working as a cook, as was young Beverly Golden, who later lived in the Bleak House Road area.<br><br>By 1920, Josephine Cobbs had been widowed and had returned home to live with her parents. She joined her brother, Calvin, who was 40, and had always lived with his mother and father, and her sister Maria Maupin, 54, who was also widowed, and had also been also born into slavery at Bleak House. No one is noted as working on this census and the ownership of the home is ""unknown."" Josephine was the informant when her father Charles died in 1922, and when her mother Angelina died in 1924. In 1930, Calvin Burley, 56, Josephine Cobbs, 60, Maria Maupin, 55, and James Maupin, 57, (identified as ""uncle"") were all living together in Charlottesville in a house at 235 12th St. Only Josephine was working, and she labored as a laundress, one of the most arduous and poorly paid jobs in the workforce. <br><br>In 1934, Josephine again reported a death, that of her sister, Maria Maupin. Her brother Calvin died in 1940. Four years later, in 1944, Josephine herself died in Augusta County. She had been moved to the Waynesboro District Home, a poor house that served a regional district that included Charlottesville. Her death certificate does not state the name of her parents and lists her occupation as ""housewife."" She would have been 85 years old.<br><br> Although her parents were not named in her death certificate, someone there knew she did not belong in the District Home cemetery.  Her body was taken to Charlottesville and she was buried in the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, where the rest of the Burley family rests. <br><br>pic(https://viseyes.org/visualeyes/projects/bleak/Waynesboro.jpg) (Josephine Burleigh Cobbs died in the Waynesboro District Home but was buried in Daughters of Zion Cemetery in Charlottesville.

s43,story,,,Isitta Bibb,"Isitta Bibb- 1859- 1914  ( Isaetta/Isetta/Iretta) was the child of Peachy, enslaved by James B. Rogers, and John Bibb.  Nothing is known about John, but the name Bibb is not a common one in Albemarle County and the white Bibb family owned few enslaved people. There is a white John Bibb on the 1870 census.<br><br. When James B. Rogers died in 1863, Isetta was 4 years old and her mother Peachy was alive and had a baby, Mary Ann. Sometime in the next 7 years, Peachy died. The two sisters went to live with Edmund Murray (1818-1880+) and are included in the 1870 census under his name, but not within the grouping of his children.  Although only 11 and 9 in 1870, both Isaetta and Mary Ann worked as domestic servants and although illiterate, did not attend school. <br><br> Cornelia Bibb, who may have been an adopted sister, also lived with them. They lived with Murray near Warner Wood’s Farmington, probably on  the eastern side of the estate.  Another family enslaved at Bleak House, the Reeds, also lived in this area.  Both Edmund Murray and Allen Reed probably worked at Farmington where Murray had  been enslaved.<br><br>Why were these orphaned girls from the Bibb family living with Edmund Murray?  Edmund appeared on two entries in the 1870 census, one, near Farmington, with his mother, Lillie Murray( b. 1792,) and several of his own children, and the other, also with some of his children but also with his wife, Theodocia, in the Brown’s Cove community. <br><br>The name Edmund appears among records of those enslaved by the Wood and the Rogers family.  In the division of the enslaved in Rogers’ father-in-law David Woods’ 1818 will, ""Edmund"" was willed to Nicholas Wood.  This might be the same enslaved person whose death was reported in 1853, (""Edmund, slave, drowned at home, age 50, owner James B. Rogers."")  Edmund Murray lived on Farmington land and probably worked for Warner Wood, Rogers’ wife’s nephew, 1865-69, and he also lived on William T. Brown’s land.  Murray’s wife, Theodosia, or Docia Ann/Dosha, was enslaved by the Wyant family near the Browns Cove area.  One of the Murray’s children, James Edward, born in 1859, was married at Farmington in 1883, indicating a long relationship with the Wood family.  But this does not explain why Edmund Murray took in the children who were orphaned after their mothers, once enslaved at Bleak House, died.<br><br>In the traditional period  of rest and celebration between Christmas and early in the new year on January 4, 1875, Isaetta married Scott Childress.  She was 16 and he, 22. She stated that her parents were Peachy and John Bibb, something she remembered although she was 10, or younger, when her mother died. Her new husband, Scott Childress, was the son of Charlotte and Randolph Childress, and they were married at ""Garth Wood’s place,"" which was Birdwood, near Farmington.  Five years later, Isaetta was working as a ""dairy woman"", and Scott was doing farm labor. They had 3 children, Margaret (1876-1923), William (1878,) and a baby, Virginia, (b.1880.)  Mary Ann Bibb, Isitta’s sister, was 19 and living with the family and contributing by working as a washerwoman. <br><br>Less than 10 years from its start, the Childress’ marriage was over. By 1885, Isaetta Childress was 26 years old and had moved to Bergen County, NJ, where she was living with a farming family named Banta. Her children do not appear on the 1885 NJ census, so perhaps remained for a time in Virginia, but not for long.<br><br> Scott Childress stayed in Albemarle County, living near Warner Wood’s Farmington and remarried there in 1892. Two years later he died of consumption. <br><br>  Isaetta remarried, too, after her move to NJ.  Her new partner was John Coles, who was born in Virginia and may also have been from Albemarle County.   Their first child, Junius Francis, or Frank, was born January 30, 1893 in NJ, followed by Elliot in 1896.  Around the time Isetta started a second family with John Coles, her daughter Maggie, then 17, had a child, Ernest Christian, who was also born in NJ.  Isetta’s son, William, had left Virginia and was living in New York and working as a tailor in 1897.  <br><br>In the 1900 census, John and Isetta Coles, their two sons and their grandson Ernest lived together in one household.  John worked as a coachman.  Isetta’s two daughters, Virginia Childress, and Maggie Christian, lived together in the same city as their mother and both worked as servants in the house of a prosperous ""jobber"" of boots and shoes.  By 1910, Maggie and her son Ernest lived next door to her mother Isitta and her husband.<br><br>In 1914, Isetta Bibb Childress Coles died.  She was described as the ""beloved"" wife of John Coles.  Her daughter Maggie remained close to her half-brother Junius Coles, and they lived together at the time of the 1940 census.  <br><br>Junius Coles married and had two children, Helen and Calvin.

He was not living with his father and other siblings in Albemarle at the time of the 1870 census and may have already left home for Washington, DC. <br><br> On October 22, 1873, John Woodford, his mother’s younger brother, placed a personal advertisement in the Washington Star asking for information on the whereabouts of his nephew. ""INFORMATION wanted of FRANK WHIPPS, colored, aged 19 years, supposed to be in Washington. Any information will be thankfully received by his uncle,"" the ad reads.  Perhaps his father, Adam Whipps, had asked John Woodford to help locate him since his brother-in-law had been living in DC at least since the end of the Civil War.  Whether John Woodford had located Frank or not, Frank’s name was in the Washington Star again Monday, September 7, 1874 for being in an ""affray"" with George Washington and George Woodfork.  Washington was fined $5.00 but the others were discharged.<br><br> By the time the 1880 census came, Frank was living in his uncle John Woodford’s household and working as a laborer. The 1897 directory for Washington lists him, and in lines above, his two brothers, Benjamin and Adam. Later censuses find him, still single, working as a waiter, and in the 1930 census, the last he was in, he was working as a laborer again, but now as a salaried worker for the government. At this point he called himself James F. Whipps.  A month  before he died, Frank’s younger brother Adam died in Charlottesville.

Rogers, but he does appear in the 1865 Fiduciary Records of the estate compiled by Dr.William G. Rogers, who was a son of James B. Rogers and his executor.  The Fiduciary Record noted that Calvin ""aged 11 (had been given) to Edward Rogers, infant son of Charles P. Rogers"" in 1863,  the year of James B. Rogers' death. He was valued at $400. <br><br>Calvin was Mariah's next to last child. He is listed as an ""advancement"", a slave given away before the inventory was made. However, Calvin remained with his family and was not sent to West Virginia where Edward's deceased father, Charles P. Rogers, had lived. Edward Rogers may have been born in Virginia and taken to West Virginia when his father moved there following his wife, and Edward's mothers', death or he may have remained in Virginia. Soon after Charles left Albemarle County, he remarried, this time to one of his cousins and they both died soon after. Edward appears in the Fiduciary records as an infant child living with his uncle, W. G. Rogers, as his guardian, and a charge for his schooling is recorded. To report Calvin as an advancement is puzzling. Perhaps it was more a matter of equalizing the segments of the estate for accounting purposes. <br><br>Calvin is the best remembered of all of Mariah's children because his son, Ross Evans, passed on stories about him, and Ross passed stories to his son, James. James Evans wrote down the stories and has shared them with a wide audience. Ross Evans was recorded telling a story about his father's experiences during slavery, <br><br>""One incident my father told about happened when he was about eleven years old. His father (James B. Rogers) gave him away to a brother's wife who was visiting from Philadelphia. My father said that when they started from home (Bleak House) the next morning, he began crying and he cried all the way to Charlottesville. The Philadelphia relatives bought my father candy, peanuts, and ginger cakes. He wouldn't eat anything they gave him. He would just cry harder. When they reached the train station, he was still crying. The station master told the relatives that they would never get him through Washington if he was making noise like that. The relatives told my father to go back home. Although it was miles away, my father ran all the way home without stopping to rest.""<br><br>This story must have taken place during the Civil War. Slavery had been abolished in Washington, DC as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation. <br><br>Calvin told his son Ross that his first job at Bleak House was at the age of four or five. At mealtimes, he stood at the dining table and waved a long- handled fan to shoo away the houseflies. Ross remembered that Calvin said ""he never saw or heard of a slave being treated badly or of any being sold away."" James Evans, his grandson, adds, ""I hope it was true, but then he was favored: he wasn't in the fields.""<br><br>Calvin was about thirteen when the slaves were freed. When he was seventeen, he left Earlysville and went to West Virginia.<br><br> Ross Evans explained, ""The railroad stopped at White Sulphur Springs, where he took a stagecoach to Anstead, West Virginia, a two day ride. There he found work as a cook for the surveyors who were surveying the railroad right of way through the valley.<br><br>After three years, he moved to Hinton where the railroad workers were building the railroad yards, having just completed the Big Bend Tunnel. About a year later, my father went up to Talcott, then miles from Hinton, to work on a steam boiler used to blow fresh air into the tunnel. This work lasted several years.""<br><br>In 1874, Calvin returned to Virginia, and on July 4, 1874, with his brother, Nathaniel (also known as Link), serving as best man, he married Ada Cave Tyler (1858-1934), from Ruckersville. The couple may have met at Mt. Sinai Church, on Simmons Gap Road in Earlysville.

s49,story,,,Moses Givens?,"Moses 1818-1870+?  Moses was one of the older enslaved people at Bleak House at the time the enslaved were inventoried and appraised after James B. Rogers’ death in 1863.  Moses was 45 and valued at $1700.  <br><br> At the sale of the contents of Bleak House in 1864, Moses  bought a ""looking glass,"" for $12.  He was  one of the three enslaved people who made purchases on that occasion, the others being Adam Whipps, who also bought a mirror, and Judy Woodfolk Reed, who bought a bedstead and comb and brush. <br><br> Moses’ surname is unclear.  He could be Moses Gibbons, or Givens, living with Rogers’ widowed daughter, Martha Woods in 1867 and 1869.  Another possibility is that he was  Moses Rogers, b. 1795, who is probably associated with Rogers’ father, Parmenas and his family.  After Parmenas Rogers’ death, ""Moses"", was hired by Rogers’ widow, Elizabeth in 1839, and in 1842-1846, according to the accounts of Parmenas Rogers’ estate.  In 1841, Moses was with ""Dr. Rogers for nothing this year but medical services.""<br><br>It is likely that Moses did not join the other enslaved people at Bleak House until 1860, after Parmenas Rogers’ widow, Elizabeth’s, death, according to birth dates in the slave schedules that were taken at the time of censuses. These dates point to Moses Rogers as being the most likely person, but there is a 23 year age discrepancy.  The 1870 census shows  Moses Rogers, b. 1795, with wife Mary, b.1805, and Nelson Foster, b. 1855,  living between Free Union and Earlysville.",http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1436/5098173117_a0a8884916.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s50,story,,,Adam Jr Whipps,"Adam Jr Whipps 1860-1937<br><br>Adam Whipps Jr. appeared on the Inventory and Appraisal for the estate of James B. Rogers, deceased, 1863-1864, as Adam Jr., 3, valued at $400.  He was the son of Adam and Cynthia Woodfolk Whipps.  Cynthia died about a year before the 1870 census, and so did a year old sister, her namesake.  Little Adam was part of a household that moved to Chestnut Avenue, a plantation that bordered the Bleak House land and lived with Nancy Michie, the elderly woman who owned it.  Adam Sr. had returned after the Civil War from his forced labor on behalf of the Confederacy.  Adam’s sister, Molly, was around 16 when her mother died and she would have been the one to care for little Adam and his siblings.  <br><br> In 1884, Adam married Teresa Butler in Washington, D.C.  Teresa was the daughter of a Maryland born farmer, William Butler, who lived in Arlington, VA.  Adam’s two brothers, Frank and Benjamin, were with him in D.C., as well as his well-placed uncle, John Woodford. According to the D.C. city directories, in 1886, Adam worked as a servant, in 1887, as a watchman, and in another directory, as a coachman. In 1887, he was employed as a laborer for the War Department, and in 1891, he was a gardener.  He worked as a clerk in 1898 and 1899.  <br><br>By 1900, Adam and Teresa were the parents of six children, Bertha, 15, Maude, 13, Agasta (Gussie), 10, Helena, 8, and Fred, 5. Two boarders lived in this crowded house, one, Nimrod Brown, from VA, was a laborer at the executive mansion.  Adam had yet another job, working as a laborer at the Agricultural Dept.  Teresa was a laundress, Bertha, a cook, and the other children were in school.<br><br>  Sometime between 1905 and 1910, Adam abandoned his family.  Teresa Whipps was left with their six children.  She told the 1910 census taker that she was a widow, and not working. However, her three oldest children were.  Bertha, 24, was a maid, Maud, 22, an insurance clerk, and Chester, 21, operated an elevator in an apartment building.  Directory listings for Teresa in 1914 and 1915 describe her as widowed, and she died in 1919.  <br><br>   Adam seems to have disappeared for a period after he left his family. He is not on the 1910 census, but in 1920, was working in D.C. as a driver at the Home for the Aged and Infirm.  In 1920, the home served 287 people, many of whom had alcohol, health or mental health problems.  It was located on 200 acres in Blue Plains and a farm there provided some of its food and dairy products.  It also had a power plant producing power for the Industrial School for Colored Children.  Adam was in a relationship with a woman who later became his second wife. <br><br> Fred Whipps, Adam and Teresa’s son, registered for the draft in 1917-1918. He was an elevator operator for the National Geographic Society and claimed an exemption from service on the grounds that he was supporting his mother. After her death, he lived with his sister  Maude, who had married a  cigar salesman. <br><br> Fred had married Louise, and in 1930 he worked as a skilled worker in the Bureau of Engraving, a job that suggests those that their uncle John Woodford had helped family members obtain. In 1940, Fred was again single and returned to live with his sister, Maude Fisher, and her family.  <br><br> Helene, Adam and Teresa’s other daughter, had married Arthur Carson, who worked as a file clerk for the government.  By 1940, the three families lived together. Maude and Louie Fisher’s household now included their daughter Rae, 23, Merrill, 19, and Maude’s siblings, Helene, 38,  and her husband Arthur Carson, 45. Fred, now, 42, shared  the six bedroom and three story brick home at 1128 Columbia Road.  Only Chester was not there because he was in New York City.  <br><br> Their father, Adam Whipps Jr. returned to Charlottesville by 1930 where he was living, like his children, with his sibling, Mollie Thomas, and a nephew, Charles Estes, his sister Fannie’s son. Adam was 68, working as a laborer doing odd jobs and with him was Mary Whipps, 56, born in MD.  She said she had been 20 when they had married and he, 45.  These dates reveal they had been together more than 35 years, a year before Adam had left Teresa and his children.<br><br> Adam jr. died December 5, 1937.  He was survived by four of his children, Fred Whipps, Maude Fisher, Chester Whipps and Helena Carson.  His second wife predeceased him by four months.",http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5150/5730585385_7c9f6d8251.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was listed with her mother, Angelina, because she was considered too young to be taken from her. She was about one year old. Together, mother and daughter were worth $3000, the most valuable of the three pairs of mothers and infants on the Inventory. Her father was Charles Burley, who was enslaved by a neighboring plantation owner, most likely a member of the Michie family.<br><br>In the 1870 census,  Ann Mariah would have been around 8. She was living with her family on the farm near or where she had always lived, and nearby were her grandmother and the children she had known since birth.

Ann would have had swollen lymph glands in her neck, perhaps with sores. This was a disease once believed to be healed by the touch of a king, but no effective cure was known in the 19th century. Ann may have been treated with mercury by both the Dr. Rogers.  It can be caused by tuberculosis, but not necessarily, especially in children.

s55,story,,,Bentley Whipps,"Bentley/Benjamin Whipps  1851-1931  Benjamin was the son of Cynthia Woodfolk and Adam Whipps.  He appears on the 1863 Fiduciary Accounts as ""Bently,"" an ""advancement,"" or ""gift"", to William G. Rogers. It may be that this was a way to even out the distribution of wealth among those who stood to inherit shares in James B. Rogers’ estate after his death that year. Benjamin would have been 12 years old.  He was not recorded living with his father and siblings at the time of the 1870 census.<br><br A remark on his 1875 marriage license said he was living in Augusta, although he had been born in Albemarle. He married Maggie Scott at Ash Lawn, now called Highland, the former home of President Monroe.  In 1863, Rev. John E. Massey had purchased the farm and had 15 enslaved workers there.  A note about Maggie’s mother on the wedding license states ""Her mother is Eliza Lewis late Scott.""   By 1875, the time of the marriage,   Massey was a prominent politician and member of the House of Delegates. It is unclear, however, why the couple was married at this location. <br><br>Benjamin and Maggie did not live in Augusta or in Albemarle County long, although their first child, William Wadsworth Whipps, was born in Virginia in 1875. Benjamin was not literate, so Maggie must have loved poetry to so name her son. They moved within two years  to Washington, D.C. where their daughter Viola was born in 1877.  No doubt the move was made easier by Benjamin’s uncle John Woodford’s presence in the city, and Whipps’ brother Frank was also making his life there. <br><br. The 1880 census shows the young Whipps family getting by while Benjamin worked as a laborer, but by 1886, he had taken up the trade of plasterer. In 1900, Benjamin had been out of work for 7 months of the past year, and Maggie, the literate one of the couple, was working as a laundress.  Their son, William, 15, helped by working as a janitor, and daughter Viola, a dressmaker, had married Joseph Washington, who was a coachman in 1898.  An elderly boarder, Mary Walker, (b. 1820), also from Virginia, shared their home and also worked washing laundry.<br><br>  The reason Benjamin had probably missed many months of work may have been the after effects of  an accident he had suffered in September, 1896, which was reported in the paper(Evening Star, Washington DC, 26 Sept. 1896) with the headline, ""Derrick Fell on Him.""  Whipps sued the District of Columbia in 1900 (Evening Star, 17 May, 1900) for injuries he  had sustained when a large overhead excavation bucket fell onto his head as he drove his horse and wagon under it. The city had been in the process of putting in a sewer and  Whipps had been returning from a ""lime kiln to which he had been for a barrel of lime,""  which he needed to make plaster. He was granted $1500 in damages for his injuries, a fractured shoulder and leg and a serious scalp wound.The city appealed the award, but his settlement was sustained.<br><br>Perhaps some of the money from the settlement was used by the Whipps to buy a house, which they owned in the 1910 census.  Benjamin was able by this time to continue his plastering work, Maggie still washed clothes, but boarders had replaced their children in the household.<br.<br> By 1920, the Whipps were nearing 70, but for the first time, Benjamin had his own business, that of a "" Kalsominer."" Kalsomining was similar to plastering, or whitewashing, involving ""good clear glue, Paris white, and water.""  It was applied with either a whitewash or special kalsomining brush and could be tinted. Benjamin continued at this work until he died in 1931, appearing in a 1930 city directory still as a ""plasterer."" <br><br> Maggie Scott Whipps died in 1940, the same year as her son, who had been a well-known pharmacist in DC.  Dr. William Whipps was a member of the Colored Druggists Association, and advertised in the Washington Bee June 7, 1919, that the association ""pledged to give you ACCURACY and HONEST SERVICE in the most COURTEOUS MANNER possible.. You will feel perfectly at home.""  Another ad in the Bee asked ""Why not patronize your own stores and be assured of COURTESY as well as SERVICE? Some stores SIMPLY ALLOW you to spend YOUR MONEY. But we not only invite you, but also desire your patronage.""  Dr. Whipps also was a pianist and, the Bee wrote in 1921, ""part of a citizens committee to equip Colombia Conservatory of Music to make it...possibly the finest colored secular music school in the country.""  <br><br> Neither of Benjamin and Maggie Whipps’ children, William Whipps or his sister Viola Brooks, left descendants.<br><br>In an article in the October 26, 2020 Washington Post, Gregory Schneider wrote about the recovery of headstones that had been removed from Harmony Cemetery when the cemetery was moved to a new site before the construction of a metro station and sold to be used as bank stabilizer along the Potomac. One of the stones recovered from the heap was the still legible stone that once had marked the gravesite of Benjamin Whipps, Schneider wrote, ""Benjamin and Maggie L.
