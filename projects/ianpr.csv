San Ciriaco,dot,6/14/1899,6/14/1899, San Ciriaco 1899,"On September 8, 1899, Hurricane San Ciriaco hit Puerto Rico just one year after the U.S. occupation of the island during the War of 1898. This Category 4 hurricane captured the souls of over 3,000 people. The U.S. military occupational government commanded by General George Davis wrote a report that advocated for the U.S. to switch Puerto Rico's economy from coffee production to sugar production in order to align with American interests. Davis also testified before Congress that Puerto Rico, because of the state of disarray the San Ciriaco caused, should become a possession of the United States and not granted autonomy. Puerto Rico's status as a territory became codified in the Foraker Act of 1900.",https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loc.gov%2Frr%2Fhispanic%2F1898%2Fsanciriaco.html&psig=AOvVaw18FogNnV9Zu7pmaS7YzmIP&ust=1623778857182000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCes-LVl_ECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD,,#00ff00,,,,dot,#00ff00,,"-66.0656,17.9626",,,"Davis, Brigadier General George W.
