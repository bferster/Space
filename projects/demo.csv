book,booklet,,,The declaration of Independence,"pic(https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/declara/images/geow.jpg,Declaration of Independence)Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. At age 33 he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored.<br><br>Jefferson chose his words for the Declaration in June 1775 shortly after the war had begun where the idea of Independence from Britain had long since become popular among the colonies.page()He was also inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual as well as the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.<br><br>He sought out John Adams who, along with the latter's cousin Samuel, had emerged as a leader of the Congress. Jefferson and Adams established a permanent friendship which led to Jefferson's work on the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>Adams supported Jefferson's appointment to the Committee of Five formed to write the Declaration in furtherance of the Lee Resolution passed by the Congress. After discussing the general outline of the document, the committee decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. The committee, including Jefferson particularly, initially thought Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson.<br><br>Consulting with other committee members over the next seventeen days, Jefferson drew on his own proposed draft of the Virginia Constitution, George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and other sources. The other committee members made some changes. A final draft was presented to the Congress on June 28, 1776.<br><br>Click zoomer(here,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.jpg/1200px-United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.jpg) to show a zoomable image of the declaration.page()pic(https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/declara/images/geow.jpg)",,,,40,,,,,,,,,,
