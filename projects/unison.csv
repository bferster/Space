s-Store,story,1880,,Unison Store,"<span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Prominently located at the junction of Unison and Bloomfield Roads, the Unison Store is the only surviving late-nineteenth-century store in the district and is a fine example of commercial architecture from that era. Constructed ca. 1880 by Lycergus E. Hutchison, the two-story, three-bay, gable-end frame store rests on a stone foundation. To the side is a one-bay, two-story frame addition with parapet. A four-bay porch with square posts and sawn brackets extends across the front of the entire store uniting the two sections.</span></span></span><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The store gained local notoriety when it was the site of a 1937 robbery/murder of its 83-year-old owner, Henry Saffel, but that was about as much excitement as the store would ever see again. The building continued to operate as a country store for the next half century, later adding a gas pump (Phillips 66), for the growing number of cars now traveling the local roads, and a pool table in the back room for some of the &quot;local boys&quot; who wanted an evening&#39;s diversion.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">However, in early 1990, due to a failing economy and the influx of paved roads out of town that now carried traffic away to bigger towns such as Purcellville, the struggling store finally closed. It remained vacant and deteriorating for several years, its fate finally taken in hand when a committee of locals decided to form an organization to protect and preserve the store, and the village. The store was purchased by Coe &amp; Maria Eldridge who They renovated the old building and converted it to a private office.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Sadly, do to the economic recession in the mid 2000&#39;s the offices were closed, and a year or so later the store was put on the market for sale. The UPS once again rallied to find a buyer that would continue to preserve the store, and also began to explore the idea of purchasing the store through the society for use as a community center. A number of benefactors came forward to help fund the purchase, but without the intervention of a local resident, Dr. Betsee Parker, the road to acquiring the store would have been long and difficult.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">When Dr. Betsee Parker, a preservationist and owner of the historic Huntland estate, less than a mile from Unison, first learned the store was for sale, she began to quietly work towards her end goal of purchasing the store as a gift for the Unison Preservation Society.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Dr. Parker, a PhD in theology, philanthropist and patron of the arts, bought and restored Huntland and its stables, kennels and buildings and put them under conservation easement to protect them permanently. She is an avid competitor in hunter jumper shows and last fall she broke the record for the number of horse show championships won by a single owner at Pennsylvania&rsquo;s prestigious Devon Horse Show. Her Huntland team of hunter jumpers then won Junior Hunter championships at both the Pennsylvania National Horse Show and six championships at the Upperville Colt and Horse Show.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The connection between Unison, the Unison Store and Huntland goes back a century to a meeting around the store&rsquo;s pot-bellied stove by the area&rsquo;s avid foxhunters, members of the historic Piedmont Hunt and the smaller Unison Farmers Hunt, which had a well known pack of foxhounds. The two joined forces and Unison&rsquo;s hounds joined the Piedmont Hounds at the newly built Huntland and its kennels, owned by Joseph B. Thomas, master of the Piedmont Hounds and president of the American Foxhound Club. After restoring those kennels in 2011, Dr. Parker, a strong supporter of the Piedmont Hounds, presided over the 100th anniversary celebration of their construction.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">With her roots deep in the local history, and her childhood memories willed with happy days playing in the old Unison store, in early April 2013 Dr. Parker purchased the restored store, and at a special celebration filled with music, food, and friends on Sunday, April 21st, Dr. Parker handed over the store keys to the Unison Preservation Society which will make the store a village community/history center and the land around it a village green. As Dr. Parker took center stage to the beaming crowd, she delivered a wonderful little speech about her many times spent playing at the store as a child, and later as an adult, while deep into her theology studies, she would often seek out the store as an oasis of relaxation and peace, a gentle enclave in which to clear her mind between periods of heavy study. Her speech was met with great applause, and as the UPS Board president, Harry Bigley, presented Dr. Parker with a beautiful rose bouquet, the applause swelled enormously.</span></span></span></p><table align=""center"" style=""border:undefined""><tbody><tr><td><img src=""http://unisonva.org/photos/Store-gift-bordered-596x308.jpg"" /><br /><span style=""font-size:x-small"">Dr. Betsee Parker with the Unison Preservation Society Board of Directors receiving the applause of the crowd at the Gifting of the Unison Store party/celebration on April 21st, 2013</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">With the purchase of the building by Dr. Parker, and her very generous gift of it to the UPS, the store is now forever protected.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Unison Preservation Society president Harry Bigley said &quot;Dr. Parker&rsquo;s generous gift will guarantee that the store and its half acre of open space will continue to be the center of village and area life and activity, as it has been for more than 140 years.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""http://unisonva.org/Genealogy/houses/May-09-Unison-old-houses016-small.jpg"" style=""width:400px"" /></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The store<br /><em>Excerpt from the National Park Service OMB No. 1024-0018</em></span></span></span></p>",https://unisonpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Unison-Store-THS-photo-with-border.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stuccoed 2-story gable-roofed dwelling features a gable roof of standing-seam metal, 2 interior-end brick flues, gable-end returns, two front doors, 2/2 windows, and a modern 3-bay front porch with square posts. Attached to the main house is a diminutive 3-bay log house with interior-end brick flue. It is uncertain which section is earlier, but it appears that the two parts of the house were constructed fairly close to each other sometime during the first half of the 19th century. The log section appears to have been used for commercial purposes. Both sections have undergone a fair amount of alteration since Osbourne&#39;s time.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:x-small""><em>Description excerpts from the National Park Service OMB No. 1024-0018.<br />Photos courtesy of F.

Before our modern livestock laws demanded fencing in of farm animals it was common practice to allow them freedom to wander and graze on common lands. Thus, the owners of nearby houses would erect fences to keep the livestock out, and their gardens safe. The elevated entry with steps up was a common construction in rural towns to prevent this ever present wandering livestock, most notably pigs, from making a sudden appearance in the parlor, as most houses had open doors during the warm months to allow better air circulation. Since pigs cannot climb steps or walls, just two or three steps leading up to the dwelling entrance was enough to deter the most determined porcine, cow, or sheep. This dwelling shows that classic raised entryway, along with a covered entrance porch.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">A shed-roofed rear brick wing (also stuccoed) appears to date to the mid-19th century, while the exterior-end stone chimney on its west side is modern.

s-Henry,story,1815,,Henry Evans House,"This home is ca. 1815. It is believed that Henry Evans constructed this house shortly after he acquired the lot from Samuel Dunkin in 1815. Built as a small 2-story, 3-bay, brick (currently overlaid with stucco), gable-roofed Federal-style dwelling, it featured 6/6 windows, mousetooth cornice, and 2 interior-end chimneys. To the rear is a 1-story shed-roofed modern wing.<p>According to an architectural survey conducted in 1982 by David Edwards, this building was not covered in stucco at that time and had exposed Flemish bond on the front and 5-course American bond on the sides and rear, and flared brick jack arches.</p><p>A ca. 1900 photograph of the house shows it once had a late-nineteenth-century, two-story frame store attached to its east end. This was one of two stores operating in Unison during the last decades of the nineteenth century, and was owned and managed by Lycurgus Hutchinson in around 1895. The store was also the local Post Office for Unison. In later years the store was owned and operated by Thomas A. Baker. At one time there was a road to the side of the store that headed towards the back of the store, and also the field behind the village. That road is now gone. It is unknown when the store was torn down, but all that remains in the 21st century is the foundation footprint next to the still standing house.</p><p><img src=""https://unisonpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LycurgusHutchinsonStore-and-PO-1895-compressed-400x300-1.jpg"" width:100%""</p>",https://unisonpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-09-Unison-old-houses007-small.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The house is composed of two three-bay sections each with its own central door flanked by a window.

In the deed from William to Caleb, the property is described as &frac12; an acre and was designated as lot 7. Thornton Walker probably built the house shortly after he purchased it in 1814.

The rear and front log portions are the oldest parts of the house. The brick section, laid in 5-course American bond, was built onto the west end of the front log section in the mid-nineteenth century. The house is another example of a dwelling in Unison that originally had two front entrances: one in the log sectionand one in the brick section. Since Thornton Walker was the village&rsquo;s postmaster, it seems quite likely that he devoted a portion of his house to a post office.</span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:x-small""><em>Description excerpts from the National Park Service OMB No. 1024-0018.<br />Photos courtesy of F.

The house also originally had a very shallow-pitched gable roof, typical of the Greek Revival style, which was raised in the 1990s to a more standard pitch.

The house commands a high knoll overlooking a meandering creek and the road that leads from Unison to Philomont. The dwelling is a comfortable blend of old and new, with the oldest section constructed as a small tenant house built around 1800.</span></span></span><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:small""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">As current owner, Mitch Diamond, explains ...</span></span></span></p><p>&quot;A few years later, around 1820 or so, [Henry Plaster&#39;s] son Michael Plaster acquired the house and property and added a federal style two story addition. The house appears on the 1854 Yardley Taylor map of Loudoun County and witnessed many of the movements of troops and fights along the road from Philomont to Unison and Upperville.</p><p>The Warburg family owned both the house and several hundred acres of surrounding land in the 1940s and 50s. Sometime during the early 20th century porches were added to the side and back of the house. More recently the house was owned by Jim Kamihachi who added a log cabin structure from West Virginia onto it and later by Robin Richards and her husband who added a master bedroom suite and breakfast room.When we bought it from Robin Richards it was called Unison Farm already and we kept the same name. &quot;</p><p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-size:x-small""><em>Description courtesy of owner.<br />Photos courtesy of F.

s-Far,story,1821,,Far Away Farm,"<strong>(formerly &nbsp;&quot;Meadow Brook&quot;, later &quot;Gray Stone&quot;)</strong><br><p>Located one mile outside the village on the NW corner of the junction of Willisville and Bloomfield Roads, and conveniently midway between Unison and Bloomfield, is the c.1821 two-story stone dwelling that is the centerpiece of &quot;Far Away Farm&quot;, once known as &quot;Gray Stone&quot; (and prior to that &quot;Meadow Brook&quot;). The name &quot;Gray Stone&quot; came from the very visual presence of a large outcropping of ancient stone just across the road from the house.</p><p>The property was purchased by George Keen from William Carter who owned the land prior to 1821. Apparently George lived in a log house on the estate while the handsome stone house was being built. It was finished in about 1821, at which point George began a systematic goal of purchasing up most of the land between Unison and Bloomfield along the Bloomfield Road to become one of the biggest landowners in the area. Upon George&rsquo;s death in 1873 the property became the residence of his son Jonathon Keen (1873-96) and then upon Jonathon&rsquo;s death it was passed down to son Harry L. Keen. Harry was currently living in the house when the 1937 photograph below was taken by researcher Elizabeth Morgan (Bluemont, VA) for the VA W.P.A. projects. She wrote in her report (now housed in the Library of Virginia archives) that &quot;the entire farm was surrounded by [field]stone fencing&quot;, and the fields were cultivated with crops.</p><img src=""https://unisonpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Faraway-1937.jpg"" style=width:100%""><p><em>&quot;Gray Stone&quot; - photos above and below taken April 6th, 1937 for Virginia W.P.A. Historical Inventory Project</em></p><p>From family history and documents: George and his younger brother John appeared in Loudoun around 1810. Census records indicate they came from New Jersey. George married Nancy Carpenter, and shortly thereafter was the executor of the wills of his father-in-law and brothers-in-law who were well-to-do landowners and slaveholders. George and Nancy had at least six children, three lived to adulthood &ndash; John, Jonathon, and Unity Keen. His fourth child, Lucy Carpenter, was born in 1857 when he was 69. George is found numerous times in the county land records, and held loans and mortgages of many small farmers. As a matter of fact, when George died a sizeable part of his estate was &quot;notes.&quot;</p><p>The original part of George&#39;s house was built in the late 1700s, and additions were gradually built over the years. The most current additions on the old house were built in the mid 20th century. The property now exists as a private horse farm, but during George&#39;s occupancy an orchard was the primary source of farm income.</p><p>Of George&#39;s children: John Keen eventually left Loudoun [and] moved to another of George&#39;s farms near Winchester where he lived until his father&rsquo;s death. Jonathon was killed in a riding accident in 1890. Grandson Harry Keen was left to manage the farms. A member of the VA House of Delegates from 1922-23, he had married Mary Virginia McCann of Winchester, VA whose father, James Kemp McCann, was a rep in the House of Delegates in 1895-96]. Harry kept the family farm for many years before finally selling it out of the family in the mid-1900s, and moving away.</p><p>The current owners purchased the property in the 1970&#39;s, and relate that the prior owner had added the second side wing to the house, the other already having been there, erected a log cabin (a relic from West Virginia) at the back of the house, and renamed the property &quot;Far Away Farm&quot;, the name it carries today. The stone addition to the back was added &quot;sometime during the Victorian period&quot;.</p><img src=""https://unisonpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Faraway-1937-2.jpg"" style=width:100%""><p><em>Photo 1937</em></p>",https://unisonpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3078-FarAwayFarm-house.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,
