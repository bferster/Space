over-1,story,22,,Traditional Tibet,"This visualization explores change in Tibet by using contemporary Tibetan artist Gonkar Gyatso’s <i>My Identity</i> series composed of four photographic self-portraits that depict his conception of different aspects of Tibetan identity across time and space. <p>The first self-portrait, which features Gyatso as a traditional Tibetan painter, is based on a photograph of Tsering Dondrup, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama's senior court painter, taken in 1937 by the American photographer Charles Suydam Cutting. Cutting was one of the first Westerners to enter the forbidden city of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet <i>(You can enlarge the photograph on the left by clicking on it).</i>  In this and the other self-portraits in the series, Gyatso assumes the pose of Tsering Dondrup.</p><p>This initial composition in the series shows Gyatso painting a thangka, a traditional Tibetan painting on cloth, that has Shakyamuni Buddha as its central figure. The Buddha is depicted displaying a <i>bhumisparsha,</i> “Earth Witness,” mudra. Gyatso wears the clothing and jewelry of a traditional Tibetan aristocrat and is surrounded by art utensils from pre-1950 Tibet. The whole setting is carefully constructed to take us back to the spaces of traditional Tibetan homes and monasteries. The colorful walls exhibit thangkas that have their silk covers veiling the paintings; a wood-carved table holds fine hair brushes, bowls with mineral pigments, and a silver-lidded teacup; a matching traditional cabinet has a flower vase on top. </p><p>Two elements remain the same in all of Gyatso’s four compositions: a little black wooden box and the artist’s pose. The initial template for Gyatso’s<i> identity,</i> Tsering Dondrup’s photograph, lingers across all the self-portraits. These recurring images form a connection between the different Tibetan ways of being, invoking the intricacies and complexities of the artist’s own search for a Tibetan identity.</p>",https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4525/38807502291_87527b8a31_z_d.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,

ava-1,story,,,Avalokiteśvara,"<p>Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the most well-known bodhisattvas in the Buddhist tradition. The worship of the bodhisattvas, also known as beings of enlightenment, is a distinctive feature of Mahāyana Buddhism. A bodhisattva is a spiritually realized being who is on the path to becoming a Buddha, one who has discovered true wisdom and attained nirvana. Avalokiteśvara is worshipped throughout Buddhist Asia and is Tibet’s patron deity. </p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4541/38688200022_3544735c60_o_d.jpg” width=""100%”>
<p>Avalokiteśvara plays a central role in many traditional accounts, being depicted as the progenitor of the Tibetan people and also as instrumental in the spread of the dharma in Tibet. When the Tibetan plateau was first formed, its only inhabitants were a monkey and an ogress. The monkey was an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara who was peaceful and contemplative, and focused on mediation. The ogress was lustful and emotionally untamed. After some hesitation on the part of the monkey, the two finally got together and produced six children. </p>
<p>Tibetans today see themselves as descendants of the monkey and the ogress. While society was still primitive, Buddhism was far too complicated for the people to understand, so Avalokiteśvara helped the people to eventually reach a level of maturity where they could embrace dharma over time. </p><p>Buddhism is said to have appeared in Tibet during the reign of the 23rd monarch of the Yarlung dynasty, Totori Nyentsen (c. fourth century). Buddhist texts and relics are said to have fallen from the sky in Sanskrit, consecrated to Avalokiteśvara. The arrival of these holy texts was planned by Avalokiteśvara and marked the beginning of Buddhism in Tibet. However, during the reign of Songsten Gampo (seventh century) who was the first of three religious kings and an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, Buddhism was firmly established (Powers). </p>
<p>In Tibet, the Dalai Lama is considered to be a manifestation of this bodhisattva. A bodhisattva is an individual who in on the path to becoming a Buddha. A Buddha is one who has discovered true wisdom and attained nirvana. In Tibet, anyone who aspires to reach awakening is considered to be a bodhisattva. Om Maņi Padme Hūm is the most important and well-known mantra associated with Avalokiteśvara, who is Tibet’s patron deity. </p><p>For religious practitioners, the mantra is a form of the name of Avalokiteśvara and the innermost heart of Avalokiteśvara. By chanting the mantra, one hopes to see Avalokiteśvara and appropriate the bodhisattva’s power, developing in this way great compassion and ultimately achieving liberation.

Tibetan Buddhism teaches its followers that we are all potential Buddhas, encouraging them to develop the characteristics of those who are enlightened by practicing meditation. There is great emphasis on the lama, the Tibetan equivalent of guru. Lamas are spiritual teachers whose long life of study and practice allows them to be placed in the role of bestowers of initiations and esoteric teachings. Tibetan Buddhists believe that a deceased lama can intentionally reincarnate in the body of a child in order to continue his or her spiritual activities.

Sonam Gyatso gained the reputation as “Virupa of Tibet” because of his efforts to prevent floods in the Jokhang, the most sacred temple in Lhasa (the reference here is to the famous exploits of great mahasiddha Virupa in controlling water). Sonam Gyatso conducted flood-averting rituals and aided with the construction of dikes. In 1563, he taught monks in the Sera, Drepung and Gawadong monasteries in Lhasa to help to repair dikes, and to protect Lhasa on the last day of the Great Prayer Festival. He clearly played a key role in acting as the protector of Lhasa.</p><p>A powerful dynasty emerged in Tibet in the middle of the sixteenth century. The rulers of that dynasty, the Tsang kings, became important patrons of the Kagyu School, a rival of the Gelug School, the school of the Dalai Lamas. The Gelug School tried to compensate for the disadvantage through seeking the patronage of Mongol leaders. </p><p>The prestige of Sonam Gyatso led Altan Khan, an important Mongol leader, to invite him to Mongolia, inaugurating an alliance that had profound implications for the authority of the Dalai Lama incarnation line. When Altan Khan met Gyatso in 1578, he was very impressed with him, and gave him the title “Dalai” meaning “ocean” in order to symbolize that he was an ocean of learning and wisdom. This is how the title Dalai Lama began and was retroactively conferred on Sonam Gyatso’s predecessors.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,hide,,
5th-1,story,,,The Fifth Dalai Lama,"<img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4543/26945265709_cc141bee3b_b_d.jpg"" width=""100%""><p>Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso came to power in 1642, and became the most dynamic and influential of the early Dalai Lamas, earning his title as “The Great Fifth” (Powers). His rise would bring Buddhism to the center of Tibetan life. The Fifth Dalai Lama paved the way for the reestablishment of a centralized government in <p>Tibet through his alliance with Gushri Khan, an important Mongol leader. The new government established by the Fifth Dalai Lama was named Ganden Podrang after the residence of the Dalai Lamas in Drepung Monastery. The Ganden Podrang government ruled the vast stretches of territory under its jurisdiction through a small bureaucracy in a kind of federation system. In that context, the many religious festivals were important in keeping the cohesion of the kingdom. </p><p>The Great Fifth himself and his regent Sangye Gyatso played a huge role in the creation of rituals and state cosmology through their many writings and government actions. The Fifth Dalai Lama build his own public image through these writings, tying together prominent Tibetan mythic and historic figures to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. Those connections were further deepened in rituals, festivals and the creation of artistic objects and architecture. </p><p>The Fifth Dalai Lama had a tumultuous childhood. Shortly after his birth, his father became involved in a plot against the Tsang king, resulting in his arrest in death and 1626. In 1618, the year he was arrested, Central Tibet and Tsang fought deathly battles, possibly as a result of disagreements between the Gelug and Kagyu schools. In the early 1630s, representatives from the Sera, Drepung and Ganden schools contacted Mongol leaders around the borders of Tibet, which would eventually lead to the conquest of political power by the Gelug School. </p><p>Sonam Chöpel was one of these representatives, and was primarily responsible for discovering the Fifth Dalai Lama. In the Fifth’s writings, Chöpel is seen as a great mediator between the lama and Gushri Khan who was the young leader of the Qosot Mongols. After Gushri Khan took control of the Tsang region between 1637 and 1641, he and Sonam Chöpel organized a welcoming party to greet the Fifth at Dechen, between Lhasa and Shigatse. Khan offered the Fifth many gifts, and a few weeks later a formal ceremony was held in the Samdrubtse Castle, the old headquarters of the Tsang dynasty. </p><p>The Fifth Dalai Lama and the Gelug School would be able to establish a long-term governmental structure and politically unify an important part of the Tibetan cultural territory. Chöpel, Khan and the Dalai Lama decided to build the Potala Palace, which would become one of the main symbols of the new Tibetan government. The Fifth Dalai Lama had intense mystical visions, largely as a result of his studying at the Nyingma School and personal past connections to Avalokiteśvara, Songsten Gampo, Padmasambhava and Atisha Dipamkara. Overall, he hoped to bring a new centralized government through the assimilation of symbolic modalities prevalent in the Tibetan imaginary of the time.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,hide,,

He was born on July 6, 1935 in northeastern Tibet, and recognized as the reincarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama when he was two years old. At age six, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama began his monastic education with the greatest effort towards Buddhist philosophy. When he turned twenty-three years old, he took his final philosophy exams in the Jokhang Temple and was awarded the Geshe Lharampa degree, which is equal to the highest doctorate in Buddhist philosophy. In 1950, the year the Chinese occupation started in Tibet, he was formally enthroned as political and spiritual leader of the country according to Tibetan protocol. A few years later, in 1956, the Chinese would try to incorporate his political capital by appointing him Chairman of the recently-established Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet (PCART). The political situation in Tibet forced him to escape into exile in 1959. Since 1960, he has lived in Dharamsala in northern India.

In 1815, at the age of 9, the Dalai Lama caught a cold, and it unfortunately took his life. <br><br>pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4515/38598999896_729e0cedfb_o_d.png)<b>Tsultrim Gyatso was the Tenth Dalai Lama (1816-1837)</b> and was born into an important Tibetan noble family. He was chosen out of 6 candidates to become the Tenth Dalai Lama, but before he was enthroned, the regent who enthrones the Dalai Lama died. Once he became Dalai Lama, he was given several different tutors, and started studying sutra and tantra beginning at age 10. In 1834, an epidemic broke out in Lhasa, and the Dalai Lama had to be confined to the Potala, and he died at age 22. <br><br>pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4562/38622869512_8b015865eb_o_d.png)<b>Khedrup Gyatso (1838-1856) was recognized as the Eleventh Dalai Lama</b> in 1840, and was enthroned 2 years later. He was born in the same village as the Seventh Dalai Lama. During his reign, Chinese influence over Tibet weakened as a result of the wars of Ladakh, Opium Wars and Taiping Rebellion. This would allow the Twelfth Dalai Lama to protect Tibetan culture from the west more thoroughly. Unfortunately, only in 1856, one year after he assumed full control of the government, he died. <br><br>pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4559/24782803858_3ae0cd5e09_o_d.png)<b>Trinle Gyatso (1857-1875) was one of three candidates to become the Twelfth Dalai Lama</b>, and upon coming to Lhasa, he was able to identify personal objects of the Eleventh Dalai Lama, indicating that he was the reincarnation. When he turned five years old, he was enthroned, and became primary monk at age nine. He started to attend the annual Lhasa Monlam in 1868, and was the first Dalai Lama to do so. At age 13, he took full control of the government. At age 19, he entered nirvana at the Potala palace, and his corpse is preserved there. <br><br>pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4577/38622877682_a6ef95bee0_o_d.png)<b>Thirteenth Dalai Lama: Tubten Gyatso (1876-1933) </b>Tubten Gyatso was discovered when he was two years old, and arrived in Lhasa at that time. One year later, the Dalai Lama was formally enthroned. When the Dalai Lama turned six years old, he began his religious training. Unfortunately, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama had to deal with the British presence in India. In 1885, the British attempted to send mission to Lhasa, but Tibet refused their military’s attempt at entering. In 1888, the two armies had their first armed conflict after fighting over land. This led to the “Anglo-Chinese Convention Relating to Sikkim and Tibet.” The Dalai Lama was hesitant about assuming political power until he reached age 20. In fact, he continued to show disinclination towards taking on political duties until 1895, when the National Assembly of the Tibetan Government called on him to assume power.  The peace broke two years into his reign, as the Chinese launched a military attack to attempt to gain control of Nyarong, an area governed by Lhasa. The Thirteenth Dalai Lama decided to dispatch a secret mission, leading to the eventual withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers.  At age 24, the Dalai Lama started having recurring dreams, seeing his life in constant danger. Later he would find out that his regent, the Ninth Demo, was trying to murder him using a pair of “enchanted boots.” During his lifetime, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama did pilgrimage to holy places in Tibet, and later in other countries. While traveling, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama was exposed to transformations occurring around the world, which showed him that perhaps Tibet was lagging behind. As a result, he attempted to bring political and social reform to Tibet. <br><br>pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4581/38623754922_f46bcc7801_z_d.jpg)<b>Tenzin Gyatso, The Fourteenth Dalai Lama is the current Dalai Lama.</b> He was born on July 6, 1935 in northeastern Tibet, and recognized as the reincarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama when he was two years old. At age six, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama began his monastic education with the greatest effort towards Buddhist philosophy. When he turned twenty-three years old, he took his final philosophy exams in the Jokhang Temple and was awarded the Geshe Lharampa degree, which is equal to the highest doctorate in Buddhist philosophy. In 1950, the year the Chinese occupation started in Tibet, he was formally enthroned as political and spiritual leader of the country according to Tibetan protocol. A few years later, in 1956, the Chinese would try to incorporate his political capital by appointing him Chairman of the recently-established Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet (PCART). The political situation in Tibet forced him to escape into exile in 1959. Since 1960, he has lived in Dharamsala in northern India.",,2,,,,,,,,"91.2471,29.7318,153",,,

Similarly to the Jokhang and most traditional Tibetan architecture, nails are not used in the construction and its walls are comprised of local stone and mud materials. Its walls slope inwards, as a way of providing support in the rocky environment.

This chapel allows for the innermost circumambulation to take place inside the Jokhang. The wooden door of the Jowo chapel is carved with detailed images of bodhisattvas, evoking an Indian style that Songtsen Gampo was heavily inspired by in the creation of the Jokhang . Upon entering, the marks of several centuries of Saga Dawa celebrations, in remembrance of the Buddha&rsquo;s nirvana, are evident. As described by Sarat Chandra Das in his journey to Lhasa in the late 1800s, the Saga Dawa celebrations involve many devouts approaching this important image of Jowo, &ldquo;[carrying] in their hands bundles of incense-sticks, bowls of butter, and khatag of all sizes and qualities&rdquo; (Das)<br><br>pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4528/38031232084_2956edcf0c_o_d.png)Of architectural interest, the Jokhang is secured by a myriad of ornate, <b>detailed pillars</b>, depicting narrative elements of Tibetan Buddhism. The columns are intricately detailed, bracketed with inscriptions of animal heads, bodhisattva moldings, foliage, and aristocratic images of jewels.

Eventually, rock and cave paintings evolved into murals. Many murals, especially early traditional ones, depict prominent Buddhists figures surrounded by detailed settings. Others depict significant figures, events, myths, and Tibetan social life. Murals are prevalent on walls, ceilings and hallways of temples and palaces. Only expert artists know how to paint the murals traditionally because they are elaborate and follow strict guidelines and principles.page()pic(http://img3.vtibet.com/en/calture/artpainting/201407/W020140731641982979913.jpg)This mural is inside the Potala Palace and it shows Tibetans celebrating the completion of the palace in the 17th century by dancing and performing.page()pic(https://cdntct.com/tct/pic/city/tibet/lhasa/shopping/thangka-03.jpg)Tangka Paintings A tangka is a scroll painting that is typically used for Buddhist teaching purposes. They are often hung like banners in monasteries or over family altars. Tangkas can be rolled up when they are not being used for religious purposes. Tangkas can either be painted or embroidered on cotton cloth, paper, or silk. The composition of tangkas is very geometric and the proportions are essential to the art. It takes expert painters and the mastery of rules relating to the number of hands, color of deity’s face, posture, symbols, and more to create traditionally correct tangkas. Tangka painters are trained for years to become masters and the master lineage often stays in the family.page()A popular tangka subject is the Tibetan Wheel of Life which represents the six realms of existence according to the Abhidharma teachings.

The Tibetan calendar is based on a sixty-year cycle called rabchung, in which twelve animals are combined with five “elements.” In this system, fire, water, earth, iron, or wood are associated to the mouse, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, bird, dog and pig years, making a total of sixty years. The 1st, 8th and 15th days of each month are all important days for each is dedicated to religious observance. In the pre-Chinese invasion Tibet, the lunar calendar was punctuated by a succession of public ceremonies and festivals that were almost always religious in nature.page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4583/23885941677_1c4013c5d2_b_d.jpg)The New Year begins with two ceremonies in which the Dalai Lama receive special guests in the Potala: Lama Losar, the “Priest’s New Year,” and the Gyalpo Gosar, the “King’s New Year” In the morning, the Dalai Lama wakes up to a ceremonial drum-roll, followed by private prayer. There is a short reception for high officials. Next the Dalai Lama goes into a formal procession on the 2nd floor of the Potala for “the accumulation of blessings for a peaceful existence.” This is followed by a formal ceremony where the Dalai Lama is served tea from a monk in a golden teapot, and several dances. Servants then bring in food, and distribute it to guests at the Dalai Lama’s permission. Following the closing precession, all the guests go home, and hold their own family celebrations with New Year presents. Every household decorates its altar, and trades scarves, wheat and barley.page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4557/38750418531_956ecf1c53_b_d.jpg)Preparations for the Great Prayer Festival, the main public festival in Tibet, begin on the 3rd day of the first month. Monks from the Drepung, Sera, Ganden monasteries head to Lhasa in the morning to take part in the Great Prayer Festival. The monks struggle to find a spot in the Jokhang Temple to sit, and stay at night. The main prayer hall in the Jokhang cannot hold more than 5,000 people at a time. There is an abbreviated prayer services, but on the 5th day, regular daylong prayer sessions begin. Sometimes, during these sessions there are also debates between candidates vying for high religious degrees. During morning sessions, tea, rice and meat are served, whereas in the afternoon only tea is served. The government funds all the activities.page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4516/38750418391_57bc28e2cd_b_d.jpg)On the 10th day, a ceremony called ‘The Time for the Gathering of the Skygoers” begins, where high officials, monks, and laymen head to the Meru Temple following the first prayer session. After several weeks of ceremonial rituals of for the Great Prayer, the 24th day marks the casting out of the Votive Offering for the Great Prayer. Mönlam Torgya is the most spectacular New Year celebration, and the longest ceremony as well. Cavalierly are joined by foot soldiers called Zimchongpa. The patio in front of the Jokhang is the center of activity where the offering takes place.  On the 25th day, there is a ceremony called the Jampa Dendren. As the moon is in its last quarter, high officials and onlookers gather in front of the Jokhang, and a cart is dragged in a clockwise manner circuit of the Barkor, and monks carry banners, incense and ritual vessels. Each day in the first month is quite eventful and makes up the events of the Great Prayer.page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4561/23885941377_1fb5bc1e3f_b_d.jpg)page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4557/38750418211_2d3460bb21_b_d.jpg)page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4516/38750417851_0d4afcbf22_b_d.jpg)The 19th day of the second month marks the celebration of the death of the Fifth Dalai Lama known as The Great Assembly of Worship. Sangye Gyatso, the last disciple of that great Tibetan king, started this festival in 1682. This is one of the many yearly celebrations created by Sangye Gyatso to commemorate the newly established government of the Dalai Lamas, the Ganden Podrang. In the case, of the Great Assemply of Worship, the prayer services lasted twelve days, and were done so on a much smaller scale than the Great Prayer festivals. Since the Fifth Dalai Lama’s death occurred in 1682, but was not publicized until 1697, there is some discrepancy about when the Great Assembly of Worship officially began.page()

The 5th day of the fifth month marks the Birthday Festival, which celebrates the birthday of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dalai Lamas. The Potala Palace and the Norbulingka palace, as well as various temples are decorated with colored flags, burning green incense from their rooftops. The Dalai Lama spends time with his family privately, and then goes to a small lake in the Norbulingka palace. After going to various pavilions for ritual activities, the Dalai Lama and his family go to Trunglha Gönkhang, which is a small temple located two miles from Lhasa. Scarves and incense are offered before they go to a summerhouse for a period of several days to entertain various guests.page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4564/23885940747_12b25bcf9e_b_d.jpg)On the 25th day of the sixth month, there is a celebration of the birth of the Eighth Dalai Lama. Kyitseluding is the site of the festival, where dancers perform Ache Lhamo, a kind of Tibetan opera, to honor the god Lichinhara, the Trunglha, birth-god, of the Eight Dalai Lama.

invasion-2,story,330,,Occupation,"<p><strong>Invasion and Preliminary Occupation (1950-1958)</strong></p>  <p>The People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet on October 7th in 1950 bringing 40,000 troops into the country. China invaded primarily to gain land and the vast amount of natural resources present in the area. Shortly after the invasion or “liberation,” in China's eyes, the 14th Dalai Lama signed the Seventeen Point Agreement with the Chinese government. This agreement placed the Dalai Lama as the ruler over Tibet and established Chinese sovereignty over the region.&nbsp;</p>  <p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4547/38752018992_59a0752cde_o_d.jpg"" alt="""" width=""66%""></p><p>In 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India on March 17th disguised as a soldier in order to escape Communist controlled Tibet. His escape was a large turning point for the power the Chinese government could exert over the region. With the Dalai Lama out of the government, China could implement the Great Leap Forward program in Tibet.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4555/37896502795_8f445d8ef3_b_d.jpg"" alt="""" width=""66%""></p><p><strong>The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962)</strong></p><p>Started in 1958 by Mao, the Great Leap Forward had as its main goal to collectivize the citizens of China into specialized communes that would produce one specific product for the rest of the country. It would be considered one of the biggest policy disasters in history as a result of those living in the collectives inflating what they produced to tax collectors and the compulsory state purchases of grain at a fixed price. The result of this was a death toll which some estimate is as high as 55 million people. This massive famine is illustrated zoomer(here, https://i1.wp.com/www.scottmanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/chinadeathratecalories1955-1964.png?w=481).  The high death toll is also evident in the effect of the world's birth rate. In short, the dimension of the policy failure of The Great Leap Forward was so great, it could be measured in terms of the effect it had on the world's population zoomer(here, https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Updated-World-Population-Growth-Rate-Annual-1950-2100.png). </p><p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4573/38065997564_84ecd959c3_z_d.jpg"" width=""66%""></p><p><strong>The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)</strong></p><p>Initiated in 1966 by Mao, the Cultural Revolution sought to promote communist ideals among those living in China as better than liberal/capitalistic ideas. Red Guard was formed by the youth of the country and many, many senior members in the government were the victims of Mao&rsquo;s purges. As many as 1.5 million died, but many more millions were subject to struggle sessions where they were tortured. The Little Red Book played a huge role in influencing millions during the Cultural Revolution, by spreading the teachings of Mao to those living under the Communist regime. Mao sought to eliminate what he called the ""Four Olds"" meaning Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and Old Ideas.&nbsp;</p>  <p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4538/37896502975_d12956874f_z_d.jpg"" width=""66%""></p>  <p>Both of these major political moves by Mao&rsquo;s regime greatly affected Tibetans who just after seeing their country be invaded by China saw their entire system change. Monks and Nuns were forced out of monasteries to work in collectives. All were forced into a regime that was trying to change its own country's years old traditions and saw their way of life changed forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1962, the Tenth Panchen Lama wrote the 70,000 Character petition to Zhou Enlai which discussed the oppression of the Tibetan people. It is considered to still be the most detailed discussion on China's policies in Tibet. It includes his firsthand experiences of seeing monasteries destroyed in the name of ""religious freedom"" under Communist control. This text was not released until 1996, a very telling fact about the control China exerts over the region.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Destruction of Monasteries&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Before the Chinese exerted control over Tibet, the region was home to more than 6,000 Buddhist monasteries. After the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, only 8 monasteries were unscathed. Here we know the locations of just 580 monasteries, one can only imagine what over 6,000 would look like. Since the 1980s, Tibetans have started to rebuild, only some of the ones on the map have actually been rebuilt. This is very tangible evidence of the control and influence these two policies had over the region and how the way of life for many Tibetans changed and how the effects can still be seen today.</p><p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4573/38752018742_68df730c0f_o_d.jpg"" width=""66%""></p>",,2,,,,,,,,"91.4441,31.6869,3000",,,
comm-2,story,374,,Communist Control ,"<p>Few believe that the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s strategy for Tibet is working today. The economic development and political repression China that have been pressed upon the Tibetan people were meant to reconcile Tibetans to Chinese rule and to make them abandon their loyalty to the Dalai Lama. These policies, much to Chinese dismay, had the opposite effect. Immolation is mainly meant to call for the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s homecoming.</p> <p>The immolations and other forms of protest are easily contained because of the heavy Chinese police presence and the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s commitment to non-violence. Not only is there an existence of the Chinese military in Tibet, but also the Chinese police are also overwhelming present in everyday life. The military play a larger role in the administration of Tibet than any other Chinese province. No Tibetan serves in the leadership of the military district governing Tibet.</p><p>Human rights conditions in Tibet remain dismal. Under the Chinese occupation, the Tibetan people are denied most rights guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights including the rights to self-determination, freedom of speech, assembly, movement, expression and travel.&nbsp;This information shows the little to no progress that Tibetans have made to free themselves from the strict rule of the Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How Do Tibetans Protest?</strong></p><ol>         <li><em>Tibetan Uprising day</em>: Protests often take place around Tibetan National&nbsp; Uprising Day on March 10th.

They are mostly non-violent to follow the path of the Dalai Lama.&nbsp;</li>         <li><em>New forms of protest</em>: In 2013 Tibetans were ordered to fly Chinese flags in their homes. In response to this, many Tibetans gathered to throw the flags in the river.&nbsp;</li>         <li><em>Everyday resistance</em>: Many of these forms of resistance are subtle. Some pray on the anniversary of Tibetan National Uprising Day, others secretly carry pictures of the Dalai Lama, and many join together to promote Tibetan culture and support Tibetan businesses. &nbsp;</li></ol> <p><strong>Self-immolation</strong></p> <p>Starting in 2009, Tibetans have begun self-immolating in response to the Chinese Rule. The peak of these protests was in 2012, when more than 80 took place. Students, teachers, mothers, fathers, and even children have self-immolated.

demo-3,story,594,,Demography,"<p><strong>The Tibetan Diaspora into India</strong></p> <p>After a failed uprising against China in 1959, many Tibetans (including the 14th Dalai Lama) fled Tibet. Groups of people from all three regions of Tibet (Kham, Utsang, and Amdo) fled to various parts of the world, but the vast majority settled in India. After decades of fluctuating population movements, there are different estimates of how many Tibetan refugees reside in India that range from 90,000 to 150,000.

While more than 80% of the Indian population identifies with the Hindu Faith, Tibetan refugees have managed to maintain their spiritual identities through the construction of traditional Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in their relocated communities. One of the most famous of these monasteries is the Namgyal Monastery (identified in white) which is associated with the Dalai Lamas and located prominently in Dharamsala. It has since become a major tourist attraction and hosts frequent teachings when the 14th Dalai Lama is in Dharamsala.</p>  <p><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4521/24890810398_2272b753d0_o_d.png"" width=""32"">&nbsp;Buddhist temples are also fundamental in Tibetan societies, and are distinct from monasteries as places of worship as opposed to religious residential and educational spaces.

However, thanks to the Dalai Lama's foresight and the collaboration with the then-Indian prime minister, separate Tibetan schools were established within the Indian education system.</p>  <p><h3>Maintaining Culture through Education</h3>  <p>Today, Tibetan literacy in India is as high as 82.4% and the Central Tibetan Schools Administration has facilitated in the creation of 71 schools which educate more than 10,000 Tibetan students. One of the most well-known of these schools is the Tibetan Children's Village, located in Dharamsala in the northeast of India.</p>  <p>Additionally, exile has forced Tibetans to constantly evaluate their personal identities away from their homeland, juggle the pressures of modern life, and decide as a culture what it means to be Tibetan.&nbsp; One way of doing this has been by means of the school curriculum in which Tibetan children learn about Tibetan history, their homeland (through modern mapping techniques), the Dalai Lama, as well as things like traditional clothing and rituals. Because it is from a Tibetan perspective, this is one vital way the Tibetan Government in exile has been able to subvert the Chinese attempts to assimilate Tibet.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Besides formal K-12 schooling, the CTA also founded and manages the link(Tibetan Institute for Performing Arts,http://tipa.asia/about/mission-statement). Music and dance is another arena in which modernity and cultural transmission can dilute certain styles and traditions.&nbsp; TIPA also features productions that pay homage to Indian cultures, but TIPA is one of the primary institutions designed to preserve and continue the musical features of Tibetan heritage, including:</p>  <p>Ache Lhamo (Tibetan opera)</p>  <p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/FRGzBcf7X-k"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>  <p>Dances from various regions of Tibet (the video features a dance from Central Tibet)</p>  <p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/xov6T9PaIgA"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>  <p>A Ka Ma Band (a fusion of contemporary and traditional folk styles from Tibet and the Diaspora that originated in the 1980s)</p>  <p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/NP7-hRCI_7k"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>  <h3>Tibetan Children's Village</h3>  <p>Another way the Dalai Lama and the Government in exile have attempted to preserve culture and the safety of Tibetan people has been by offering childcare and education through the link(Tibetan Children's Village,http://tcv.org.in/content/tcvs-mission). The first was founded in 1960 by the Dalai Lama as a response to more and more refugee children arriving in India ill and malnourished.&nbsp; The network has expanded over decades to encompass various residential schools, day schools, and vocational training across India.&nbsp; Not only does this institution help maintain cultural heritage, but it also offers relief for refugee parents.</p>  <h3>Higher Education</h3>  <p>The link(The Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education,https://www.dalailamainstitute.edu.in) is the latest innovation of the Tibetan Children's Village in an effort to provide higher education.&nbsp; They offer Bachelor's degrees in Tibetan &amp; Chinese Languages, Commerce, Computer Applications, Economics, History, Politics, English, Journalism, and Psychology.&nbsp; They also have a Ph.D program in Tibetan Studies.&nbsp; It also appears to be relatively accessible, as all TCV students are eligible for full scholarships. This effort can be seen as a response of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to the rapidly modernizing and globalizing society they have found themselves in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Another major source of higher education for Tibetan refugees is the link(Central University of Tibetan Studies,http://www.cuts.ac.in/). This University offers studies in Buddhist philosophies including the Sakya School, the Nyingma School, the Gelug School, and the Kargyud School.&nbsp; It also offers studies in the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet, commonly referred to as Bon.&nbsp; Additionally, there are studies offered for various social sciences, languages, education, traditional Tibetan art, Tibetan medicine (with its foundation in Bon), and Astrological sciences called Bhot Jyotish Vidya.&nbsp; Once again, the educational structure for Tibetans in exile features traditional and modern topics to renegotiate Tibetan identity away from home.</p>  <h3>Literary Preservation</h3>  <p>The Tibetan literary canon was once one of the most expansive in the world.&nbsp; Once the Tibetan writing system was created, the many monks/nuns and monasteries in Tibet dedicated themselves to recording historical and religious teachings.&nbsp; However, when China came and destroyed monasteries across Tibet, many literary works were lost.</p>  <p>When fleeing, Tibetans clamored to keep some of their cultural literature and brought a hefty amount to India.&nbsp; This is where, in 1965, an American scholar named E. Gene Smith encountered Tibetan refugees and learned under various lamas.&nbsp; Through this effort, he was able to maintain original pieces of Tibetan literature with the Library of Congress in the U.S.&nbsp; He also spent over two decades making copies of Tibetan works for further dissemination.&nbsp;</p>  <p>During this time, he was able to take advantage of U.S. link(Public Law 480,http://www.merip.org/mer/mer145/public-law-480-better-bomber), which ""enables food-deficit 'friendly countries' to purchase US agricultural commodities with local currency, thus saving foreign exchange reserves and relieving US grain surpluses.""&nbsp; This money was then invested in the preservation of Tibetan works.&nbsp; In 1999, Smith founded the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center, which was expanded and renamed the link(Buddhist Digital Resource Center,https://www.tbrc.org/#!footer/about/missionhistory). This organization has ""located, digitized, cataloged, and archived over 13.5 million pages of culturally significant Buddhist works"" in order to ensure they remain open to the public.</p>  <p>Alongside these efforts, the 14th Dalai Lama founded the link(Library of Tibetan Works and Archives,http://tibetanlibrary.org/history-of-ltwa) in 1970. Not only is this institution dedicated to preserving and disseminating Tibetan and Buddhist texts across the world, but it also offers classes in Tibetan language and religious practices in India.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span style=""color: #000000;""><img src=""http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/50/2c/7e/library-of-tibetan-works.jpg"" alt="""" width=""309"" height=""412"" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""http://images.tripsbank.com/public/upload/destinations/1271/thumb/The%20Library%20Of%20Tibetan_901.jpg"" alt="""" width=""311"" height=""416"" /></span></p>",,2,,,,,,,,"77.8367,21.6755,6000",,,

The controversy came to the point where the Dalai Lama’ safety was in direct harm leading him to flee his homeland and thus change the landscape of the Tibetan government.  page() pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4520/38722161311_a6343b7a27_o_d.png)Up until the Dalai Lama’s exile in 1959, Tibet recognized itself as an independent sovereignty. Before the exile, The Ganden Phodrang was the Tibetan government originally set up by the 5th Dalai in 1642. The government towards the 1940’s was organized in which the Dalai Lama was the lead executive power within the government and then under him was the Kashag governing council. The Kashag was comprised to be the Dalai Lama’s most trusted advisors as the council was divided into “representatives” from seven different divisions: political, military, economic, judicial, foreign, financial, and educational departments.

The new government was intended to be the governing body of all exiled Tibetans throughout India and the entire world, its purpose was stated as it was “not designed to take power in Tibet” and would be dissolved “as soon as freedom is restored in Tibet.” This new government started from humble beginnings of an initial capital of what equates to $1,120 USD. Recognizing that the Tibetan exile would take place over a long duration, the Dalai Lama began to take a more western, democratic approach towards his governmental approach. On Sept. 2 1960, democratic steps were taken when the Tibetan Parliament in Exile came into existence. In this Tibetan Parliament, candidates were nominated by the exiled citizens and then later voted on. In 1990, the Dalai Lama increased the number of Parliament members to its present day amount of 46.  page()pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4519/24849412788_e36937e055_o_d.jpg)While in Dharamsala the CTA began to continually progress. In June 1991, a constitution was drafted called “The Charter of Tibetans in Exile”. This 26-page document laid out the policies and structures the CTA was to follow moving forward. The charter encompasses the universal Declaration of Human Rights specified by the UN, while also ensuring that all Tibetans have equal treatment and freedoms under law regardless of gender, age, religion, or origin. Another key distinction within the created within the charter was the separation of power within the government into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. As within the government before the exile, the Dalai Lama was designated with the executive power, the highest authority within the government. The legislative authority was then vested in the newly created Tibetan Parliament. The CTA effectively was divided into seven departments, similar to the format of the government during the later Ganden Phodrang time period back in Lhasa. The divisions were Religion & Culture, Home, Finance, Education, Security, International Relations, and Health; each performing separate tasks and functions to ensure the longevity of this community in exile. “The Charter of Tibetans in Exile” is what the CTA operates under even till today. There were still changes made throughout time as we see the Tibetan government morph towards implementing Western ideals into their governing structure. page() pic(https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4581/38722162141_92732e3045_z_d.jpg)In 2001, we saw an unprecedented move as the Dalai Lama proposed that the executive authority within the government be split between himself and another individual, for the first time in history. Soon after this proposal was accepted, we saw the first democratic election take place amongst Tibetan exile voters to nominate who would share the executive power with the Dalai Lama. The sharing of power continued for another ten years before eventually evolving into its present day democratic power structure. In 2011, the Dalai Lama himself petitioned a proposal where he would be relinquished of his formal authority within the government and a newly elected official would hold the executive office. The petition was eventually voted on and approved, and in May 2011 the Tibetan exile voters elected their new Sikyong (president), Lobsang Sangay. Many viewed the relinquishing of power from the Dalai Lama concerning but he states, “My desire to devolve authority has nothing to do with a wish to shirk responsibility,” he said, according to a prepared text of his speech. “It is to benefit Tibetans in the long run.” The shift in government authority from the Dalai Lama to an elected official can be seen as an attempt to align the Tibetan government with Western ideologies and influence.",,,,40,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,WORLD DIASPORA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wd-1,story,814,,The World Diaspora,"At the close of the 1980s and the First Wave of the Tibetan diaspora, a new generation of transplants began to disperse further outward from India. Due in part to a newly developed public interest in Tibet and the human rights issues surrounding the Chinese occupation, as well as a growing number of foreign government assistance and various charities, assistance programs, and humanitarian aid, there was now not only incentive for Tibetans to move outside of Asia, but also the means to do so. <br><br> This Second Wave of the diaspora brought Tibetans in direct contact with the Western world and its culture on a large scale for the first time. With refugees beginning to settle not only in Western Asia and Europe, but North America as well, these previously traditionally-minded Tibetans began to develop lives of their own in their new host nations. <br><br>Some resisted the culture of their new homes, choosing to forge small, tight-knit communities in order to insulate themselves from the creeping influence of Western society. Others chose to fully assimilate, integrating themselves completely into whatever nation chose to adopt and shelter them. And others still chose to adopt a more cooperative perspective on their situation, creating unique, hybrid societies which combined their cultures with that of their new environments. <br><br> Through this period, an entirely new subset of Tibetan identity began to emerge, one that reflected not only the traditions and customs of old Tibet, but also the influences that the Western world began to have on these newly-displaced peoples. This new wave of Tibetan immigrants and refugees struggled to continue the ways of their homeland, while still adapting and surviving in their new homes.<p><b>About Identity 4</b></p>This conflict of identity is represented in full by the 4th photo in Gonkar Gyatso’s “My Identity” series, which depicts a modern-day Tibetan citizen of the Global Diaspora, attempting to reconcile his Tibetan heritage with a contemporary and Western setting. The figure sits in a very modern, Western-looking room, with nearly no sign of the Tibetan accents that adorned the previous photos. However, despite this non-traditional, non-Tibetan environment, the figure, Gonkar himself, still shows signs of his heritage. His tattoo is in traditional Tibetan script, and his painting is a highly stylized version of a Tibetan mandala, used in religious rituals. Although the figure is clearly no longer in Tibet, he still seeks to represent and practice his cultural traditions, which is why the painting is the perfect representation for those who relocated during the World Diaspora.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

wd-2,story,858,,Demography,"The Global wave of the Tibetan Diaspora saw Tibetans leaving their homes in not only Tibet, but India and Nepal as well, in order to seek new homes all over the world. According to a census in 1998, by the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in Dharamsala, the number of Tibetans (both in nationality and ancestry) living throughout the world is around 120,000. <br><br><i>Click a country on the map to learn some specific historical and demographic information for each, or read below for a general overview of each continental region.<br><br> Note that population data is often conflicting, and the numbers presented may not represent current population estimates. </i> <br><br> <b>South Asia</b> <br><br> The first area settled by those in this Global wave of the Tibetan Diaspora was South Asia, simply due to proximity and ease of access for those initially leaving Tibet. The CTA lists 52 different Tibetan refugee settlements in the region, with most located in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Many others also live in other large cities which host others of differing nationalities (the CTA only tracks settlements of predominantly Tibetan peoples). These 52 settlements tend to adhere closely to Tibetan customs and traditions, often with a monastery or some other religious body as the center of the community, both geographically and culturally. The South Asia region is also the most actively changing in terms of the motion of Tibetans peoples in and out when compared to other regions, with many young students moving for education, and older demographics moving for religious purposes. <br><br> <b>Europe</b> <br><br> Many of those who did not settle permanently in South Asia instead moved outward, into the Western Hemisphere, a process which started in the 1960s. Switzerland was one of the first nations to allow Tibetan refugees to settle within its borders (with an initial wave of around 1500), with other Scandinavian nations quickly following suit, albeit in much smaller numbers (with a little over 100 living there now). The rest of Europe allowed for the immigration of Tibetan refugees soon after, with around 640 Tibetans living throughout Europe today. <br><br><i>Click the ""Interactions with the Western World"" section for more specific information on Tibetans in Switzerland.</i> <br><br> <b>North America</b> <br><br> After the relative success of the Swiss relocation of Tibetan refugees in the 1960s, the Dalai Lama began negotiations with the Canadian and American governments in the 70s for similar arrangements. While the United States remained initially uncooperative, the Canadian government allowed for around 200 Tibetans, mostly from India and Nepal, to enter the country early in the 1970s. The first official wave of immigrants to the United States would not occur until the 1990s, although scattered groups arrived in small numbers before then. Canada now hosts a Tibetan population of around 5,000, with the United States hosting just above 11,000. <br><br><i>For more information on Tibetans in Canada and the United States, click the “Interactions with the Western World” section of the timeline.</i>",https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4536/24895391938_8597c62b90_o_d.jpg,2,,,,,,,,"35.3935,10.2588,40000",,,

Despite the fact that the vast majority of these Tibetan transplants fled their homes due to pressures created by the Chinese occupation of Tibet, several western nations, such as the United States and Switzerland, are now forcing Tibetan nationals to identify in official government documents and census materials as Chinese in ethnicity.<br /><br />This is due to a variety of reasons, predominately that most Western countries tend to have at least some sort of friendly relationship with China, at least economically, with the United States in particular not willing to do much to antagonize one of their closest trading partners. And since China does not recognize Tibet as a separate, sovereign nation, nor do their allies tend to do any differently. Also, from a purely logistical standpoint, it is much easier for governments to group Tibetans in with the Chinese, considering that, technically speaking, Tibet is, in fact, a Chinese-controlled territory.<br /><br />
And in the case of Switzerland, and many other European nations, the rising anti-immigrant sentiments in the public eye are making it more and more difficult to give Tibetans special treatment with refugee status. The impact of these policies is the unfortunate loss of any official recognition from host governments of a real difference between Tibetans and Chinese, which, to those who fled specifically to escape Chinese influence on their lives, is a massive blow to their cultural identity.<br /><br /><em>To navigate through this map, click on the starred countries to get more specifics about their relationship with Tibetan refugees.

Switzerland was one of the first nations to offer support, with the Swiss Red Cross taking full responsibility of the endeavor from the government. About 100 officially arrived in 1964, following the earlier settlement of six smaller Tibetan communities in eastern Switzerland, mostly in small villages. As of this time, there were around 300 resettled Tibetans in the mountainous nation, along with around 150 orphaned Tibetans who had been adopted by Swiss families. Andy by the end of the 1960s, there were over 1,000. Today, around 4,000 Tibetans reportedly call Switzerland home (official sources are somewhat contradictory), making it the largest concentration of Tibetans in Europe.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.sir.ch/wp-content/uploads/srp016.jpg"" style=""height:280px; margin:6px; width:450px"" /><br>(the Rikon monastery)</p><p>The Tibetans who arrived during the first initial wave into Switzerland had a relatively easy time acclimating to their new environment. They were housed in communities specifically designed to aide them in preserving their customs, and even had a monastery built for them in the village of Rikon. Geographically, the Swiss landscape was not much different than their own, so there was a familiarity in their surroundings that helped to ease the transition, which is the featured picture.<br /><br /> In fact, the notion that the Tibetans were &ldquo;mountainous people&rdquo; was one of the main reasons that the Swiss accepted them with such open arms, as they felt a kinship in their similar, elevated upbringings. The Swiss people were also no friends to the Communists, particularly the Chinese, so they were especially sympathetic to the political turmoil in Tibet.<br /><br /> The original Tibetans who arrived in Switzerland did not have much difficulty finding employment, either. Men worked in textile mills, or as carpenters, gardeners, groundskeepers, or general day laborers. Women found jobs in gardens, but also as housekeepers and tailors. Swiss employers at the time noted that the Tibetans under their employ were extremely fast learners, and excellent workers, despite somewhat of a language barrier. In the smaller communities, income and earnings would go into a communal pool, which would then be equally distributed, with slightly more being paid to the men than the women.<br /><br /><strong>Difficulties</strong><br /><br /> Like many other areas in the Western World settled by Tibetans, those in Switzerland initially faced an enormous language barrier, as they knew neither Swiss nor German, nor did the Swiss know any Tibetan. This continues to be a problem for new arrivals even today. However, the largest issue facing modern day Swiss-Tibetans has to do with the official recognition of their nationality. In July of 2016, following policy changes within the Swiss government, the Tibetans living in Switzerland were suddenly faced with a drastic change: They must now identify as Chinese, rather than Tibetan.<img alt="""" src=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8efa151c664eec286cea85894291581765f334a7/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c62bf821df6ef37584544a24f6f1fddc"" style=""height:270px; margin:6px; width:450px"" /><br>(from The Guardian: Tibetan and Swiss nationals protesting against a visit from the Chinese President in January 2017)</p><p>As a result, Tibetans are finding it more and more difficult to get official recognition as a refugee. This change is due to multiple factors, predominantly of which are the newly conservative immigration attitudes that are on the rise in Europe, and the relaxation of animosity towards China, for economic purposes. For Tibetans who fled specifically because of Chinese political pressures to preserve their Tibetan identities, these policy changes have almost completely undermined their efforts, and have been an enormous blow to their cultural identity.<br /><br /><em>Click on another city or country to compare their resettlement policy and strategies.</em></p>	",,,,,,,,,,,hide,,

While Canada&rsquo;s first interactions with Tibet actually began in the late 1800s, with several missionary trips to the country by Canadian religious scholars, the first Tibetan citizens didn&rsquo;t arrive in Canada until the 1970s. In the decade prior, at the height of the unrest in Tibet caused by the Chinese occupation, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) approached the Canadian government about allowing a small number of refugees settle in Ottawa, as the agricultural land their matched what they were used to in Tibet.<br /><br />
After several years of internal debate and uncooperative resistance from the Canadian government, an agreement was finally reached in which 228 Tibetan refugees were allowed entrance into the country in 1971. These refugees were settled in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba, and it was decided that the possibility of future Tibetans being accepted into the country would be determined by the success of this first batch.<br /><br />

These original 228 Tibetan refugees were carefully selected, with favoritism shown for those who were single and of working age, or relatively young, married couples, so many others were skipped over and left behind. The Canadian government also collaborated with the Dalai Lama, who specifically chose refugees representing the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism.<br /><br />Because the Tibetans were immediately scattered throughout 11 different areas in various Canadian provinces, forging communities with one another was nearly impossible. They also faced a massive language barrier, with no knowledge whatsoever of either English or French.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://parkdalevillagebia.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9517.jpg"" style=""height:256px; margin:6px; width:455px"" /><br>(the Tibetan Canadian Cultural Centre Opera Group)</p><p><br />However, within three years, nearly all 228 of these Tibetan refugees, who came to the country with nothing, had become not only gainfully employed, but had established homes and lives for themselves. It is at this point that small, tight-knit communities began to develop, with three areas in particular serving as hubs of Tibetan culture: Ontario, British Columbia, and most notably, Toronto.<br /><br /><em>Click one of the three Canadian cities on the map to learn more about the Tibetan Communities they each host.</em></p>",,,,,,,,,,,hide,,

And this number is expected to grow exponentially, with projections reaching the 10,000 mark within a decade.<br><br>So why have so many Tibetans recently chosen to settle in this relatively small, unassuming neighborhood in Toronto? Simply put, because the sheer number makes it seem so much like home for newcomers. The primary language spoken here is still Tibetan, and much of the country&rsquo;s cultural, religious, and social practices are still observed here, making its nickname of Little Tibet all the more accurate. The small neighborhood is such an insulating, preserving force for the Tibetan way of life that some residents even claim that Tibetan culture will soon exist in a more pure form here than in Tibet itself.<br /><br /><strong>Economy</strong><br /><br />
Being such a haven for Tibetan peoples and their culture, Parkdale is also, naturally, home to an entire micro-economy hosting a wide range of Tibetan businesses. Residents have established restaurants, which serve traditional Tibetan cuisine, shops selling craft supplies and various religious paraphernalia, and even prayer and language centers, to both help new arrivals adapt, while still being able to practice the traditions they grew up with. See the map for a short video tour of the area by a resident, showing a few of the Tibetan-owned businesses in the area.<br /><br /><strong>Community</strong><br /><br />
Additionally, numerous community centers have been set up, which cater to not only the neighborhood&rsquo;s youth, but also to its older citizens as well. These centers help recent immigrants settle in, and provide services such as transportation and job assistance for those who have not yet been able to quite plant their roots. They also host a multitude of cultural events, ranging from traditional Tibetan festivals and rituals, to educational seminars designed to teach those born in Canada about their ancestral home.</p><p>Below is a video showing one of these community centers celebrating the birthday of the Dalai Lama.</p><iframe width=""480"" height=""270"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4G6utwC2U8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",,,,,,,,,,,hide,,

Interaction between Tibet and the United States was virtually nonexistent before the latter half of the 20th century. Although there were infrequent, scattered cases of individual Tibetans entering the US beforehand, with some arriving as early as the 1890s, the vast majority did not arrive until the height of the Tibetan Diaspora. Despite negotiations taking place between the Dalai Lama and the United States government in 1970s, a real, serious attempt to resettle Tibetan refugees in any considerable numbers did not occur until the 1990s.<br /><br />
The Immigration Act of 1990 finally allowed for official provisions to bring Tibetan immigrants into the country, in an initial wave of around 1000, by way of visas. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), in an effort of fairness, hosted a lottery of sorts, to determine who would receive these visas and by the late 1990s, the Tibetan population in the United States had risen to about 5,500, due mostly in part to the success of the initial 1000 and the desire of many others to reunite with family members who migrated in this first wave.</p>
<p>Since then, there has been a steady stream of Tibetan immigrants and refugees, both in and out of the United States, with more contemporary estimates placing the overall population somewhere around 11,000. Major areas of settlement include New York City, Northern California, Colorado, and Virginia (among many others), and the effects of their culture can be seen in others, like Austin, Texas.<br /><br />

Early in the 1950s, the United States CIA began involving itself in the affairs of both Tibet and China, by inserting agents in in Tibet to train its citizens in the skills they needed to rebel against Chinese occupation. Gyalo Thondup, brother to the Dalai Lama, assisted the US government in their efforts in the region. Using him as a contact, the CIA was able to bring several Tibetans to a secret facility located near Leadville, Colorado, in order to train them in combat tactics. After several decades of obstacles to the program, including lack of funding and the United States’ growing diplomatic ties with China, it was eventually decommissioned in 1974.page()</p> <p>pic(http://coloradotibetans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/west-coast-5-550x400.jpg) Now, Colorado is home to a vibrant, active Tibetan community, one which is one of the most dense concentrations of Tibetans in the US. Following the CIA-Tibet program of the late 20th century, many more Tibetans gradually made their way to Colorado following the Immigration Act of 1990. Colorado is now home to around 300 Tibetans, as well as Naropa University, a private school founded by a Tibetan Buddhist teacher and focused on traditional Tibetan Buddhist ideals.

The Tibetan community in New York City is incredibly diverse, with refugees from Tibet itself, from India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and even transplants from elsewhere in the Western world, relocating to live with their families. Many of these immigrants initially came under tourist visas, and chose to stay, rather than return home.

While there is a small population of Tibetans in Austin, their impact on the area is much less a result of their physical presence, and much more to do with the West’s adoption of several cultural aspects of Tibetan life, the most significant of which is Tibetan Buddhism.page()</p> <p>pic(http://www.palri.org/images/498_ll_tib_sangha_web.jpg) Austin is home to a thriving Buddhist community. The city hosts dozens of temples, meditation centers, religious education facilities, and several other establishments focused on Buddhist rituals and traditions. Buddhist traditions from Sri Lanka, India, and Tibet, as well as from smaller, fringe sects are all represented here. And while not all of these facilities are based in Tibetan Buddhist, there is still a significant Tibetan presence. For example, the Palri Pema Od Ling temple is one of the city’s most popular Buddhist destinations. Adorned with a large, ornate statue of Guru Rinpoche, who historically helped to construct the first Buddhist temple in Tibet sometime in the 8th century, the temple is headed by Lama Lobtsul, an ordained monk born and raised in Tibet. With an actual, “authentic” Tibetan religious leader, the temple is one of the few places in the United States that boasts an opportunity for eager converts to educate themselves on Tibetan Buddhist traditions. See the next page to get a better look at the temple and the day-to-day events held there.page()</p> <p>  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXu-gw0mW94"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> page()</p> <p>pic(https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth301547/m1/1/med_res/) The city of Austin is also home to the Tibetan Association of Austin, who, as their name suggests, seeks to keep traditional Tibetan rituals and customs alive through performances and educational events designed to not only entertain, but also to teach the public about Tibet.",,,,33,,,,,,,,,
wd-4,story,946,,The Dalai Lama ,"<p>The Dalai Lama, in the decades following his exile from Tibet, has been one of the main driving forces in unifying the various Tibetan communities scattered around the globe. He has become, among other things, the face of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism, not only within the culture and religion itself, but within the wider world as well. He is a spiritual, political, and social leader, serving as an anchoring point for the thousands of Tibetans spread all over the world. And most importantly, he serves as a singular, identifiable figure by which all Tibetans, no matter where they happen to be, can recognize, learn from, and ultimately rally behind, making him one of the most powerful and influential people in modern age.<br /><br /><strong>In Popular Culture</strong><br /><br /> Part of the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s effectiveness in unifying not only the Tibetans in various regions of the world, but all other groups of Buddhists and general practitioners of Eastern religions as well, is his sheer prominence in the media and popular culture. Advances in technology in the past several decades has made it increasingly easy for the Dalai Lama to communicate with his followers en masse, allowing him to both educate them and bring them together in mutually-beneficial platforms of discussion.<br /><br /> He makes frequent appearances on television and other entertainment media, spreading awareness of both Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. He is relatively active on social media, particularly Twitter (you can see some recent posts below), where he gives inspirational messages, and also occasionally announces speaking events and other educational and community opportunities. His link(website,https://www.dalailama.com/) also allows for his followers to track his schedule, read news about Tibet and its people, and generally stay informed on all aspects of their culture. These tools allow for an incredible amount of transparency and accessibility to the Dalai Lama and his affairs, which gives his followers a wealth of tools in which to both see and hear him and his teachings, as well as communicate with one another, through events organized by him and his various organizations.<br /><br /><strong>The Kalachakra</strong><br /><br /> The Kalachakra is an extremely important system in Tibetan Buddhism. It has a somewhat dual definition, referring to both a deity-like figure, as well as a series of ritualistic traditions. The deity represented by the Kalachakra is a Tantric one, representing a figure that has achieved enlightenment, and as such, perceives time from a perspective of total omniscience. The concept of time is essentially the heart of the Kalachakra, with the name itself meaning &ldquo;Cycle (or Wheel) of Time.&rdquo; It represents not only the cycle of time, but all other cyclical concepts as well, from astrological cycles of planets and stars, to physical biological cycles like breathing, to cycles of energy within the spiritual body. These concepts are expressed through a complex Tantra. In visual representations of the Kalachakra through Mandalas, the Kalachakra deity is positioned directly in the center, in his palace, surrounded by various other pieces of Buddhist iconography.<br /><img alt="""" src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4570/26992766199_2600c58377_z_d.jpg"" style=""height:254px; margin:6px; width:450px"" /><br /> It is a primary goal for practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism to learn about the Kalachakra, and how to shape one&rsquo;s mind to a perspective that allows one&rsquo;s self to understand and identify with the deity and the concepts behind it, on the path to enlightenment. In essence, the Kalachakra is all about understanding the natural organization and structure of the universe, from both a physical and a spiritual perspective, and how everything ultimately exists in a state of perpetual cyclical motion.<br /><br />For a more detailed breakdown of the Mandala representation of the Kalachakra and all of its components, click link(here,http://kalachakranet.org/mandala_kalachakra.html)<br><br>The role of the Dalai Lama in the Kalachakra is one of a teacher and an initiator. To begin practicing the rituals of the Kalachakra, one must be first educated on all the intricacies of the rituals, as well as then be given permission to practice them. As such, the Dalai Lama himself performs Kalachakra initiation ceremonies all around the world, in order to allow those who wish to practice the ritual, and therefore take further steps towards enlightenment, to do so. This practice is extremely fitting, as one of the Kalachakra Tantra&#39;s most important features is that it is given for a community. By teaching more and more people the Kalachakra, The Dalai Lama is not only allowing more and more people to properly practice Tibetan Buddhist traditions, he is also bringing them together as a unified body, as the Initiation rituals garner massive audiences.<br /><br /><em>The blue dots on the map are every Kalachakra the Dalai Lama has performed since exiled, starting in 1954.

In a nutshell, the ceremony serves to educate the attendees on exactly how to practice the Kalachakra Tantra. Students must pledge to honor and preserve the teachings they are given during this period, although the extent to which they do so is ultimately up to the individual. The centerpiece of the Kalachakra initiation is the construction of the Kalachakra Mandala. This is done by the Dalai Lama himself, who sits center-staged, flanked by various scrolls and iconographic symbols. After the Mandala is constructed, the students are then given various ritualistic rites, and are then allowed to view the Mandala. The ceremony ends with a series of prayers led by the Dalai Lama and the careful removal of the Mandala.<br /><br /> To read a detailed explanation of the entire Kalachakra ritual, click link(here,https://www.namgyalmonastery.org/the-kalachakra-tantra/kalachakra-initiation).<br /><br /><em>Click on the blue dots to see the years, location, and attendance of the Dalai Lama&#39;s Kalachakra rituals.</em></p><br><br> <a class=""twitter-timeline"" href=""https://twitter.com/DalaiLama?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">Tweets by DalaiLama</a> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>",https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4517/23903766007_b38b895f4c_z_d.jpg,2,,,,,,,,"4.7046,25.0657,39136",se,basemap:earth,

wd-5,story,990,,Global Tibet,"<p>Gonkar Gyatso&#39;s fifth iteration in the <em>My Identity</em> series was painted in 2014. It encapsulates Gyatso&#39;s maturing understanding of a global Tibet-- a Tibet with one foot in and one foot out of a western, modern world. Gyatso is very aware of the fractious self-identity that faces Tibetans in the diaspora.<br /><br /> <em>&quot;Emotionally and ethnically I am Tibetan,&quot;</em> he explains, <em>&quot;but socially and politically I feel British, since Britain is the country that granted me citizenship and gave me rights and a sense of national belonging.&quot;</em><br /><br /> And yet, Gyatso doesn&#39;t see the introduction of modern, capitalist values into Tibetan culture as all negative. In an link(interview, https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/meet_the_artist/meet_the_artist_gonkar_gyatso-5660) with Artspace, he describes the necessity of striking a balance:<br /><br /> <em>&quot;The problem with modern practice is that its objectification of culture is often exploitative and leaves those who gave birth to the culture at the losing end. On the other side, when religious practice becomes too extreme it can be oppressive. My ideal is a co-existence between the two and I try to reflect that through my work.</em><br /><br /> Gyatso&#39;s skillful and thought-provoking combinations of Western and Tibetan Buddhist imagery is emblematic of a culture in flux.<br /><br /> <em>&ldquo;Just as the identity of my homeland cannot be separated from religion and politics, so my own sensibility has been shaped by the undeniable bond between the two.&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>NGOs</strong><br /><br /> Despite being scattered all over the world, the individual Tibetan communities that have developed in the wake of the Diaspora do not exist in isolation. Rather, due to a steadily increasing number of factors, these small, pocket communities are becoming more and more connected with one another, creating, for lack of a better term, a Global Tibet, outside of Tibet itself. Technology has played a huge role in this, with services like WeChat allowing Tibetans to communicate with one another, worldwide, even in areas with restrictive communications policies (although whether or not services like these are <em>actually </em> secure is up for debate).<br /><br /> One of the most unifying forces of the Global Tibetan community, besides the Dalai Lama himself, is the existence of an extensive network of Non-Governmental Organizations, or NGOs. These NGOs exist on a massive, global scale, with literally dozens, if not hundreds of them existing in almost every nation that hosts Tibetan citizens, and even some without. These organizations usually take the form of community centers, but can also be the headquarters of various political and social movements, namely Free Tibet.</p><p>All of these NGOs operate under the organizational structure of the International Tibet Network, which maintains a record of all its individual branches, and helps to organize events and information between them. Through the International Tibet Network, Tibetans, as well as those who support their struggle, have banded together to form a super-group of interconnected organizations, helping to maximize their political, social, and cultural effectiveness worldwide.<br /><br />Click link(here, https://tibetnetwork.org/) to visit the website of the International Tibet Network.<br /><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/livebookswordpress/uploads/sites/411/2010/09/prayerglags_002.jpg"" style=""height:300px; margin:6px; width:450px"" /></p>",https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4582/24895266658_d13dfa0861_o_d.png,2,,,,,,,,,http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GonkarGyatso_MyIdentity_5of5_print.jpg,,

process,story,,,About this project,"<span style=""font-size:24px;color:#999""><b>www.viseyes.org/identity</b></span><p>This visualization is about the profound changes experienced by Tibetans in Tibet and in the diaspora context over the last decades. It is the final assignment of Introduction to the Digital Liberal Arts (Media Studies 3703), a project-based learning class that uses interactive technology to explore topics in the humanities. In this presentation, students look into how Tibetan identity has gained new and complex features using contemporary artist Gonkar Gyatso&rsquo;s work as a guide to the geopolitical, religious, and cultural changes in Tibet and beyond Tibet, from traditional times to the modern diaspora. The result is an interactive visualization using SHANTI&#39;s VisualEyes tool that tells the story in an engaging manner.</p>
<p><strong>UVA research seminars (RSEMs)</strong></p>
<p>This class is a prototype of an evolving effort at the University of Virginia to connect undergraduate students and faculty in creating an interactive visualization that invites deep inquiry into that faculty member&rsquo;s research interests. These seminars use the project-based learning instructional approach to encourage an authentic relationship between the students and a faculty member&rsquo;s research activities. Students develop meaningful research questions through exploring, structuring, and analyzing primary sources and successfully communicate their findings using modern technological approaches.</p>
<p><strong>The process</strong></p>
<p>The class was divided into two parts. In the first, we read many articles and book chapters on Tibet and discussed them in class. We also read chapters and articles on various aspects of interactive visualization. These readings were supplemented with lectures in equal measure on both topics, guest lectures by three religious studies scholars.</p>
<p>Students were asked individually to make a simple visualization using the VisualEyes to understand the mechanics behind the tool. During the latter portion of this half, we began to discuss what a visualization encapsulating our readings and lectures might look like.</p>
<p>The second half started out with class discussion that honed the subject of the project finer and we all decided to use Gonkar Gyatso&rsquo;s paintings as a framework to talk about change in Tibet. The class was divided into four groups, with each one focusing on one of the paintings and class time alternated between small group meetings and whole class discussions and feedback on their individual portions.</p>
<p>We made great use of Google Docs to facilitate communication both within the groups and a mechanism for the instructors to &ldquo;stay in the loop&rdquo; during class time. The latter portion of class time was spent on groups finishing their part of the visualization, culminating in a public presentation at UVA&rsquo;s historic Rotunda 12/5/17.</p>
<p><strong>Student groups</strong></p>
<p>The Traditional group was made up of Katrina DeFilippo, Margaret McCoy, and Jane Nelson.<br />
The Chinese Tibet group was Anne Morgan Hunter, Abigail Lague, and Brent Reutter.<br />
The Indian Diaspora group consisted of Cory Harris, Hannah Mussi, and James Swanson.<br />
The World Diaspora group was Shane Brooks and Isabella Ciambotti.</p><p><strong>About VisualEyes</strong></p>VisualEyes is an HTML5 web-based authoring tool developed at the University of Virginia to weave images, maps, charts, video and data into highly interactive and compelling dynamic visualizations.
